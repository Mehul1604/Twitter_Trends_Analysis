We have to increase our domestic investments to sustain this confidence: PM .

INDvAUS Okay so even Burns is getting his form back now. I've seen it all. INDvAUS Would absolutely love to see them haters faces if India wins from here. Praying for a miracle. INDvAUS Kohli should not go home after this display to be honest. It's a matter of country pride now. INDvsAUS I'm taking a break. INDvsAUS Adelaide  Unreal scenes at Adelaide!! Shambles! INDvAUS   I liked the way he announced RANT OVER after blasting Oxenford for silly decisions 😂😂😂   That was fucking stressful in 2018. It almost seemed like they’ll chase it. Ashwin took the last wicket in 2018.  Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha. Oh Vaughan you mighty jinx!!!!!  Yesterday you praised Pujara and in like 10 minutes he was gone. I am hopeful now. 😂  Thank you. I can fathom people feeling its dicy but people who are mourning is just bizarre.  I like the fact that you guys are wearing ties and serious stuff for the serious part of the tour.

Test has moved far away from IndianCricketTeam  reach !!
10/5 unreal collapse
INDvAUS  15/4 or 67/4 in either case it's disastrous situation for IndianCricketTeam !!!

INDvAUS Still better bet than PrithviShaw 
AUSvIND  PrithviShaw test series has ended !!
He is sitting duck against that incoming ball against Hazlewood Starc Cummins .
No way he is playing second test.
AUSvIND Free Runs !!!

Sarkari khajane mai paise nahi islye MSP is not good? What about 1000 crores spent on advertisement by govt every year then? What is logic behind this? Dont be that foolish  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  Apko bhi😊🙏🏼  AUSvINDtest AUSvIND INDvsAUSTest This test is done and dusted.  and  need to focus on what went wrong in this 1 hour while preparing  for the 2nd Test. With Hazlewood and Cummins in this kinda form, any team would crumble down. AUSvIND INDvAUS   Reality strikes back..When India won back in 2018, there was no Smith in the side and Cummins and Hazlewood were not on this kinda form. Now they are. India staring at a 4-0 Whitewash. AUSvIND INDvsAUS   It's 19 for 6 but Still India can fight back. If Vihari and the rest can raise the score to 150, then 200 is more than enough for the talented Indian bowlers- Shami Bumrah and Ashwin to defeat the Aussies. Let's hope for the best AUSvIND INDvAUS    It's a funny game. Just before 45 minutes Indians were dreaming to win the game. Now they are desperately wanting to save it. AUSvIND INDvAUS    Total bloodbath. 15 for 5. Rahane's record when he is under pressure, in the 2nd innings is very very poor. He has never responded well with a fifty when under pressure.   need to reprimand him for this. AUSvIND INDvAUS With Agarwal and Pujara gone, India in trouble here at 15 for 4. Although including the lead it is 68 for 4, still not enough. AUSvIND INDvAUS   With Pujara gone for a duck, Australia slightly ahead now in the game. Huge responsibility on Kohli and Agarwal now. AUSvIND INDvAUS
Predictions for today:- Boomrah 0-5, Agarwal 18-27, Pujara 20-29, Kohli 128-137  AUSvIND INDvsAUS India in a strong position here. It should win the Test hereon. AUSvIND INDvAUS   Does  have such flaws in his batting technique which have been exposed by the opposition as what Shaw has? NO. Then why didn't the selectors choose him instead of the erroneous PrithviShaw?    IPL fans might consider Boxing day test to be something related to Tyson vs. Holifield INDvAUS AUSvIND  Inzamam Ul Haq  Gill on current form especially in tests. He has got 78 as FC average.   I can see 1 down for not many in atleast first two tests . Gill is very unlucky to miss out. Ji chaa gye apRubikaLiyaquat  That's good  Tbi thappad pdta e ise ,  Ok , calm down . Its 2020  Thought so , and one more thing i am living independently since i was 18 . So , the loser here is you.

AUSvIND Tail ender's B-I-A-T-C-H  May sound superstitious, but ICT and LFC has done extraordinary things whenever i opted to not follow due to work/disinterest/sleep.
Prime ex. Trentbridge 2018 (basically whole test leg),perth day 2,MCG day 1, barca home UCL so might be tempted to not follow next day. 

AUSvIND  Mayank should be backed for all 4 tests imo  You thunk we could whitewash poms on lifeless chepauk and ahamedabad drop in pitches? LMFAO  Boria ManCuMdar told shaw is an incumbent opener so he should play atleast next test on today's show mf basically an unofficial bcci member so..  But bcci would go with shaw as an opener and lolhul at 4 due to ExPeRiEnCe SCENARIO 1:
P Shaw to open in MCG with gill batting at 6 and Vihari at 4.
SCENARIO 2:
Vihari opening with gill at 6 and Lolhul at 4
SCENARIO 3:
Lolhul opening with gill at 6
You can't expect a debutant to open against best pace attack in world as simple as that

  Is baar Trade Fair nhi lgaa na Delhi me,
To in logo ne hi lagaa dia hai.  Australians ka dil to jeeta hi hai. Isse jyada score to Sachin, Sehwag, Saurav, Dravid, Laxman, and Dhoni aaj bhi bina practice ke khel jaaye to bhi bnaa denge. 😁

INDvsAUSTest IndiavsAustralia  India ne 36 bnaaye,
But Australia will have to chase 90.

QOTD quote Congrats  and  for the launch of the physical book worldwide. Started reading it and it's intense and thought-provoking about various crises through history over the last several hundred years.

INDvAUS What are somethings where the past _may_ be a reliable predictor for the future?

- Ethics
- Mindset
- Attitude

Others?  Great time for Business Hotels to push Staycations!    Charge sheet has been prepared basis the dying declaration. Judiciary has a high degree of prejudice here so has these so called brave female journalists. It’s not a case of gang rape period I have no doubts abt it. Prejudice is so high here wait till it reached HC. I said 3-1 Aus will be 3-0 I think it rains at Sydney. Aus want revenge for 2018 and they are upto it INDvsAUSTest Are we going to see a typical 2nd innings collapse by India . Ans is Yes 165 all out max could be 120 also . Aus to win by 4 wickets. INDvAUS India to score 165 in Second Innings. Australia will win by 4 wickets on 4th Day INDvAUS Quote from one of the most influential feminist for more gems like these, read The Second Sex (1949). Have always believed men with there freedom,masculinity &amp;money have build the world for all,few things are wrong but in General men have got it right.   PSU banks were always bad expect SBI but if SBI falls because of sentiment will be buying more of it. Rem all this has been already included in the NPA only case has been filed now.  All test cricket should be played with pink ball red ball needs to be discarded and only Duke or SG balls should be used with better seam. Pink ball will get rid of those time when bad light stops play.    There is a Noise and prejudice in the tweet itself Sir. INDvsAUSTest

Le Ashwin ...   Mi fans 🤧🤧.... Cup vechurkara thimiru la pesuraainga 🤧😂 I wouldn't go to the hackneyed conclusion of complimenting MSD's captaincy to be the reason why this list has no entries from his era..

But on a individual level, he was the tenacious resin of the team that made sure there was some respite every time the batting order collapsed   I personally don't mind VK being the Captain... Agreed today was a colossal failure, but it's not really his fault, and it happens in sport.... In fact we haven't really failed in tests like this so far under VK...

This Rohit captaincy lobby is getting nauseating now  Yaaraa venaalum captain Ah vechutu pogatum, aanaa paara batchcham paakaama pudhu captain-aiyum thittunaanga na podhum 😂😂  Ikr... He may nt have changed the result... But we mightve atleast saved some face 🙂🙂

  Appreciate you for this criticism joy... This critique is one of the more constructive ones, pointing out the lack of professionalism or the duty of the commentator instead of tainting it with a misconcieved notion blanket of 'racism' No don't miss my man now
Don't ask him to save you from this collapse
He won't give u overseas century no 🙂🙂
1929 
INDvsAUSTest INDvsAUS AUSvIND  Exactly... That's smart.. And that eventually became his game plan.... And in the later stages he followed that strategy to perfection and got results...

But people make it seem like he's incompetent against top notch bowlers... Which is not the case Thalaivar putting the purists to shame...
This may not be the textbook variety of aesthetic strokeplay....But it's a lesson on why going out of the book and doing it in your style does the job, if your name is MSD.

That cover drive at 1.31 😍

Dhoni you beautiful Virtuoso 😍💖✨  Brett Lee, Dale Steyn, Shoaib Akhtar, Lasith Malinga......The list goes on 🥱

MSD has been spanking the best bowlers with utmost ease even before he became a force to be reckoned with....

To all those who say he can only 'target' weak bowlers...  AUS v IND, 1st Test
AUS 43-0 &amp; 191
IND 36-9 &amp; 244

Day 3: 2nd Session - Australia need 47 runs

Click here to view more :  INDvAUS  INDvAUS  INDvAUS  No Batsmen Reaching Double Figures in an Innings SA v Eng Edgbaston 1924 30 all Out Highest 7 by Herbie Taylor (extras 11) Ind vs Aus Adelaide 2020 36 all Out, Highest 9 by Mayank Agarwal INDvAUS INDvAUS   This is probably wishful thinking, but looking forward to a dramatic fightback in the next session. AUSvIND We have to give it to them; Cummins and Hazlewood bowled exceptionally well and asked the right questions of the Indian batsmen. AUSvIND Takes a rather special effort to even perform the way our batters did. AUSvIND Will be difficult to move past this. AUSvIND Looking at what Marnus is picking up, Smith might tone his mannerisms down a bit. :D INDvAUS Marnus looks all over the place. INDvAUS A little fuller and straighter might help. INDvAUS Even though the scorecard at the moment may suggest otherwise, the Aussie openers haven't looked and/or been troubled at all. INDvAUS I think one reason why the Aussie quicks were more effective early on was they attacked the stumps far more than their Indian counterparts are doing so at the moment. INDvAUS Not much lateral movement off the deck for Bumrah or Umesh.  Have managed to keep things quiet so far. INDvAUS A tragicomedy in 3 acts. Gawks had not seen test cricket since the 90s.  😂😂😂😭😭😭 INDvAUS  Missed the first session because of sleep deficit. Woke up, saw score, and realized how important my sleep health is to Aussie bowlers! 😢 INDvAUS  Just a couple more days. Then it's back to evening. 😁   Laxman went through a similar stretch of getting bowled through the gate. He worked on it, but was still often vulnerable to those incoming deliveries even till the very end. Pretty good career anyway.   So?  Whaaa? You are munchies immune?  (I don't, not out of any snobbery or puristry, but simply because I don't enjoy them enough anymore to watch 8 hours. The payout is better in T20 and tests in my personal calculus.)  Just said that. Bowling arm too!!! 

Nothing’s going right for India atm At this point Shami should just move out of the way &amp; get bowled out to avoid getting tired so he can come out and bowl well

Surgery to replace part of cheek and jaw and radiotherapy got rid of the cancer. 

Now me and my stick blender are very happy together 🍐🍇🍉🍏🥭🥐🥖🥨🍕🥪🍨🍧=🥫🍜   Would u blv b4 this hit out of left field last year I could have said the same abt me. 

Very rare instances of being sick even with the sniffles

And then, wham!! The big C

Life, what can you do but live it eh?   Your visualisation helped with my radiotherapy as well. I always imagined the radiation attacking my cancer cells exactly like this. 💜 This immediately made me think of the part in Down to Agincourt where Castiel describes Dean’s immune system fighting Croatoan

“An army unseen but vast, its numbers beyond counting, has just picked up their swords.”

   Well i must admit I’ve owned one of those models for years and it’s a wild ride....  Great thread explaining the Covid19 vaccine and how it functions

AUSvIND _xx But Karan Jotwani left the show..😢😢   What is distorted ?? Did Akbar not rule India??   Best tweet of the week😂 Everyone will somber around Indian playing XI choices but somebody also needs to talk about how the modern Indian batsmen are harmed by their trigger movement. INDvAUS I know Kohli wants and should be given the paternity leave but just to keep the team in a positive frame of mind for the next 3 games, he should stay. Fingers crossed. INDvsAUS INDvsAUSTest Kohli Game on !!!! INDvAUS Hard on a bowler this, after bowling 20 odd overs now he has to face the brunt of new ball under lights. INDvAUS Might not bother Ashwin much but his wait for a fifer in SENA countries continue. INDvAUS India's catching on this trip till now has been miserable. Dropped catches might be in double digits. INDvAUS 43% of Smith's Test dismissals involve stumps directly or indirectly. It has to one of the highest for a batsman. INDvAUS Smith has struck 7 Test centuries in his last 8 outings against India. So beware Indian bowlers. The real test has just begun. INDvAUS 3-4 years ago Umesh wreaked havoc with new-ball against Sri-Lanka. Might be the day to test his new-ball skills again. INDvAUS So India lost 7 wickets for 56 runs. INDvAUS INDvAUS 😂😂😂

INDvAUS  There they Go with their Anti-Kohli agenda again.
Ganguly this, Dhoni That.
Please enlighten me, how's a collective batting failure the Captain's fault?
His only fault in the second innings was throwing his wicket away.

INDvAUS AUSvIND _vishal  I clearly conceded Kohli's fault in the first line itself. So There's no disagreement there.
But to scapegoat Kohli for a collective team failure, that's not right either. _vishal  Yes we should, but we should also the expect rest of the batting order to help in the building the innings as well right?
Because that's literally what their job is?  Where's Kohli's fault here? Apart from his rash shot?
It was a collective batting failure, Can't blame Kohli for that singularly? Can we?

Was India 54 all-out in Sharjah, Dada's fault ? Team Pandits? There de you go with your Xenophobic hate.
But yes cry foul, when some says something on your religion.

December 19 : Captin Kane back to training when his team need him most

What a commitment from King  Kane 👑

And great to see him in T20I arena after 11 long months 🤩

NZvPAK AUSvIND  India need a Kane Williamson kind of cool head right now 

His temperament and mindset in pressure situations are next level 

Virat Kohli and Steve Smith may have better stats but they can't perform like King Kane in tough conditions and situations 

AUSvIND INDvAUS  If it is true that would be phenomenal news

My dear North Indian movie lovers i always feel you guys missed Vintage Raviteja in his prime days so don't miss at least now

Great thing is you guys getting blockbuster movie like Krack unlike his previous dud movies

KRACKONJAN14    Good for him but bot good for team 

Last I saw him in New Zealand he scored 31 runs in 5 ODI innings with average of 6 

BTW that's the worst ever performance in his career 

He is a good player but need to prove lot against big teams in tough conditions &amp; situations  Check your previous message  First ask him to play then I'll decide whether I watch his batting or not

Look sir all I said about that particular situation and performing in NZ conditions you guys gone to England, Australia &amp; Namibia 🤣

Good night mate relax 👍🏻   Cheers brother   Download not possible I tried all method just use any screen recorder _Cricket  Maybe beyond further it depend on NZ home schedule after T20 WC  Babar Azam scored scored 31 runs in 5 ODI innings last time he toured New Zealand

 Such a dilemma .. want Aussies to be wrapped up quickly .. but also dont want Indian batsmen to face the music under lights 🙈 INDvAUS PinkBallTest I feel for the Australian bowlers .. to come up with variations of speed and craft and bowl their best at 140 odd .. only to be left alone or played by Pujara .. personally I would have given up in 12 balls !! INDvAUS PujaraPower  He can just dance on random tik toks .. uber talent .. but going waste Shaw lasted 2 balls .. yes .. just two balls 🙈 INDvAUS Looks like Big Sam is winning the 'English Manager Housie' hands down !!

  via  MUFC can go above Chelsea with one game in hand .. 

.. means 1-0 loss after a Ramsdale goalkeeping masterclass 

SuchIsTheSeason After a long time .. saw a good first half performance by MUFC .. the PE teacher is not that bad afterall !?! ManchesterDerby MUNMCI Interesting read .. one to follow Tesla  As we have the second T20 .. the true Test players are shining .. Rahane with an unbeaten ton and Pujara with a 50 .. looking forward to the tests now !!

Of course the delivery is world class but where is talent gone?
AUSAvINDA    எப்புடி? அவங்க அப்பா அம்மா கூட இருக்குறதுக்கு பேர் குழந்தை துன்புறுத்தல் ல வருமா?  Earlier it was looking dangerous with Smith, labus now Tim Paine to be removed to finish up the 1st innings quicker... INDvAUS   Absolutely it's valuable! The bowling unit is really strong and the Field set up was very crucial, moreover it's a test match  
Mottainku wicket koduthuttanga 
So sad...
indvsaus  No one will give go for a drive in 2nd ball of the test cricket especially with pink ball 31 overs has gone still able to hit only two boundaries, Australian bowling unit is impressive

indvsausT20 Scoring runs are important whether it is test ,t20 or odi .. India is fucked up by not scoring runs and staying in the pitch just like a aimless person 🙏 Ashwin ❤️❤️.. should open the innings .. looking at the form he is in .. a century in Australia is what we all expecting  .. play prithvi down to the earth (no 10)  INDvAUS  unstoppableashh  + jisko wo laga raha bowling par sb wicket la rahe bechara kaise hata dein bina 4-5 overs ka spell diye 🤭🤭🤭  3 fast bowlers on a fast bowling pitch .. 16,19,16,16 ...  Nice captaincy virat kohli   Thandak bardaast karlo to naha lo 🙏 _vidhu Jamoga se abhi bhi darr lagta hai kya .. offside ka badshah jamoga  Atrocity,glory, arrogance everything 🙏  And play with 10   You can only see his abuses not his hunger for game !! You are never gonna understand him .. assume anything you think !! He is an inspiration and champ and i admire his arrogant and angry  character .. these things has made him what he is now ❤️ AUSvsIND
People here complaining about tail but it's Paine who had scored runs.

Batting with a tail is an art.That's y we need a keeper with batting skills.

Indian so called experts and commentators barking every day to play 4 proper bowlers and 1 proper keeper makes me sick🙏 AUSvsIND
Wonderful knock from Paine.👏👏👏
Captain innings👌

But ind need to play 7-8 overs atleast I think.
Will be very difficult.

INDvAUS AUSvsIND
This is how tail should bat!!!

Our tail just thrown the wickets away.

BC kitne catch drop karoge bhai🙏🙏🤷‍♂️ AUSvsIND
I won't be surprised if Australia declares after 10overs by scoring quick runs runs now.

INDvAUS AUSvsIND
I think need to be bit defensive without giving away runs.

If they get them all out by 10overs then we need to face new ball under the lights for atleast 15 overs.

INDvAUS AUSvsIND
Biggest prob of Umesh is that he gives away easy singles.
INDvAUS AUSvsIND
Wattt a catchhh!!!
This man is always in the game Kohli😍😍😍 AUSvsIND
Shaw has serious attitude issues. Was sloppy on the field and even after that he looked sloppy while stopping another ball.

INDvAUS AUSvsIND
Omg fielding is of worst level.

In tests u can't drop a catch..in this case they r dropping sitters🙏🙏

INDvsAUSTest AUSvIND    Leaving us with a haunting image of Meredith, GreysAnatomy will be back next year with some of the old cast members, hopefully on the beach! 👀      CBI's chargesheet seems to have rescued the HathrasCase 👀 Now, need for some swift action! PrithviShaw is 21. Yes, it was a big opportunity missed. But lest we forget - HE IS 21!!!  INDvAUS  Australian bowlers need to show some crazy histrionics tomorrow to match our bowlers' performance today. Truly sublime Ashwin &amp; the night watchman Bumrah has been the Pink cherry on top! INDvsAUS     seems to be the night watchman for the commentators! 👀 
INDvAUS  Bumrah Anyone watching today's match won't say that Cricket is a batsman's game. The ball is definitely in the bowler's court! 😀 
Aus - 79/5 INDvAUS Ashwin Kohli CameronGreen       kept a cool Head and Travis got out! 
Aus - 65/4
INDvAUS  TravisHead     strikes!

Check out Mathumenan Varatharajan's video! TikTok  🌾💛😘🥰  கிளிநொச்சி 🙄  No wonder we get crap in newsroom and comm box.. Same yield.. No difference...  He would have made a brilliant captain...  I bet, why can't we get this    Surprise surprise.. Ganguly not getting his partner out but it had to be SRT... Any other batsmen would have been out ten times ... Only great man had the understanding with SCG....  Hemantbhai, it is sheer ego of team management 2 c obvious in team selection as well choosing to bat first while knowing fully well that, aus has unsettled opening pair, half fit Steve Smith,our bowlers would be right on top instead we are two down for nothing..  INDvAUS  Post lunch or dinner whatever you call.. It will be ok time to bat.. Post tea would  be difficult..  I am being proved right and it is painful.. 41/2 at lunch... Aus should have been on backfoot with our kind of bowling..  Wait, our man  is a seasoned batsman.. Once he is settled on pitch.. Whoever you get.. Nothing is going to happen..  Still stupid decision of bat first.. Knowing that aus have unsettled opening pair, half fit Steve Smith.. They should have gone for kill right away rather than putting batting under pressure for no reason. Too much ego at play.. INDvAUS  Amazing . Huge respect for parents... I being one had tough time reading this... You also must talk about parents who had to take such a difficult decision..

AUSvsIND INDvAUS TestCricket Amazon is plain weird sometimes. For some unexplained reason, Dhyan Chand's autobiography comes with a free handkerchief.   🙏🏻🙏🏻 Kohli's captaincy is worryingly reminiscent of Dhoni in his later years as skipper: simply going through the motions, desperately waiting for something to happen.

_s_Eye Remember when we used to get on the computer just for paint "My mom likes you" is one of the most elite compliment Everyone to Prithvi Shaw right now :  AUSvIND  INDvAUS

Everyone to Prithvi Shaw  When you try to play PUBG on mobile with 2 gb RAM

Mobile be like : The only way to stop the habit of manstrubation.....  _Yadavg 4 ft 2" Kuch ladkiya haste khelte ladkon ko bhaiya bol kar zinda laash bana deti hai........  What a switch we've had. From high scoring T20s and ODIs to less than a couple of runs per over, only a couple of balls touring the ropes, and that fight for every run, every ball is still an event, it's just great. Damn! I love Test Cricket.

INDvAUS PrithviShaw ViratKohli Loved this impromptu performance by LuckyAli in Goa.

He Dosanjh disappoint you ❤🌻

DiljitDosanjh diljit DiljitVsKangana DiljitRocks 💔🥺🌻 msdretires MSDhoni7  AUSvINDtest AUSvIND INDvsAUSTest This test is done and dusted.  and  need to focus on what went wrong in this 1 hour while preparing  for the 2nd Test. With Hazlewood and Cummins in this kinda form, any team would crumble down. AUSvIND INDvAUS   Reality strikes back..When India won back in 2018, there was no Smith in the side and Cummins and Hazlewood were not on this kinda form. Now they are. India staring at a 4-0 Whitewash. AUSvIND INDvsAUS   It's 19 for 6 but Still India can fight back. If Vihari and the rest can raise the score to 150, then 200 is more than enough for the talented Indian bowlers- Shami Bumrah and Ashwin to defeat the Aussies. Let's hope for the best AUSvIND INDvAUS    It's a funny game. Just before 45 minutes Indians were dreaming to win the game. Now they are desperately wanting to save it. AUSvIND INDvAUS    Total bloodbath. 15 for 5. Rahane's record when he is under pressure, in the 2nd innings is very very poor. He has never responded well with a fifty when under pressure.   need to reprimand him for this. AUSvIND INDvAUS With Agarwal and Pujara gone, India in trouble here at 15 for 4. Although including the lead it is 68 for 4, still not enough. AUSvIND INDvAUS   With Pujara gone for a duck, Australia slightly ahead now in the game. Huge responsibility on Kohli and Agarwal now. AUSvIND INDvAUS
Predictions for today:- Boomrah 0-5, Agarwal 18-27, Pujara 20-29, Kohli 128-137  AUSvIND INDvsAUS India in a strong position here. It should win the Test hereon. AUSvIND INDvAUS   Does  have such flaws in his batting technique which have been exposed by the opposition as what Shaw has? NO. Then why didn't the selectors choose him instead of the erroneous PrithviShaw?     Have a great day _SSMB  Very good morning 😂😂 _srii  Vgm

SarkaruVaariPaata   Very good morning   Very good morning Pujara should be the brand ambassador of Ambuja cement. Solid as usual. INDvAUS _Cricket Bhai tu fantasy p focus kr.. Jyada gyan mt de.. Fantasy b tujhse smbhali nhi jaati. Hey .  Given the injury to ishant sharma. How about playing Deepak chahar in dayNight test? He can be lethal with new ball specially under lights. He can bat a bit too. INDvsAUS Cheering for  tonight. IPL need a new winner. 170 would be good considering the pressure chasing. IPLfinal 🤩⬅️ My face when harsha bhogle said RCB ARE THROUGH TO PLAYOFFS RCBvsDC Andddd we are through to playoffs.
 🤩😎 I am not even near to ground why am i feeling the pressure. 😑Let's do it boys  DCvRCB IPL2020 I guess iyer made a mistake by bowling first. When your Batsmen are not performing you must bat first in a pressure match. Go rcb 🤩♥️ DCvRCB To do list today being a RCB FAN :

1- Support csk against punjab
2- Make sure winner of KKR VS RR doesn't win with a healthy margin.

If this happens then I can sleep peacefully today.

RCBvsSRH RCBforever IPL2020 my weekend started with absolute nightmare cos of Indian cricket team and what's waiting for me is my football team  man utd face high pressing Leeds who also happens to be rival weekend godsaveme I thought only Manchester United can hurt me emotionally , but team india manged it .. not in a wildest dream i expected this.. no backbone.. i just miss someone with jersey no.7 and i m the biggest critic of him INDvsAUS  dhoni _topc Yup cos last time out out batting was very good.. this time too many new faces.. we needed Rohit,pant,pandya _topc Playing relatively inexperienced players for the first time in aus vs the best ever pace attack the world has ever seen..too bad by coaching staff and selectors Selectors or kohli.. who should pay the price?.. INDvsAUS Unacceptable INDvAUS Exactly my thoughts too.. not upto this level ... atleast for now   It may sound harsh but he doesn't belong to international level.. not only here but on NZ and in Dubai for IPL.. need to pick a solid opener i would say to an extent like a Murali Vijay mould Kohli and team management have to be responsible for Shaw's flop... Why pick a batsman who is out of form actually looks like he don't belong to this level INDvsAUS Gareeb aadmi hai jhola uthata hai or nikal jata hai😂   LFC Fans and there celebration

Talent is so underrated.   _cricket  I hope he doesn't end up like  who is in the pic as well.  is liked because of his current post. It's going to be a different story as soon as he is out of captaincy. India needs a new leader.   is so overrated! His U19 team mates are doing much better. IPL2020 DCvKXIP  Lal Bahadur Shashtri ji ke janam din par aap ko bhi badhaiyaan Why not!!     No one is jealous. Don't think your generation has seen M.Bevan. He taught the world how to finish games. Test match needs a dedicated coach..  removed Anil Kumble one of the dedicated and hard working man from coaching job bcoz players don't like his commitment and replaced him with RaviShastri  ... It is expected.

AUSvsIND INDvsAUS AnilKumble RahulDravid  Test match batting different. Although  brings lot of new talents test talents need to be found by a different route.
India looked good last few years bcoz of its bowling strength.
This is where Pujara comes in. He played more than 1200 balls last trip.    do i need to have 's default tracking protection enabled when using uBO?  .. _Android  
How to stop Android tab refreshing themselves when switching tabs?
When I have default tracking protection on page loading takes time than when it is off.
If have  installed do i need default tracking protection of FF. Good test match talents never appreciated by  and fans.

For example VVS never selected for ODI world cup team.

Now any hit &amp; miss player can earn CRORES and FAME by just being (not even playing) in an  team.

AUSvsIND INDvsAUS cricket I'm saying this for a long time. Too much focus on T20 by players, BCCI and viewers too. This will lead to poor test matches.
India looked string last few years bcoz of bowling attack and poor opposition (including Aus).

After continuous losses, Cricket is not relevant till I'm captain.

AUSvIND INDvAUS INDvAUSTest Ro needs to be captain atleast for white ball cricket. India is touching new low under kohli's clueless captaincy. India deserves better captain.

AUSvIND INDvAUS INDvsAUSTest  Just stating facts bro. Didn't troll. All hopes on bumrah now. RCB under kohli - 49 all out
India under kohli - 36 all out

He broke his own record as he got tired seeing no one is beating it. That's all from clueless captain for now.

And same happened with Rahul, he failed in England (2018) and every one wanted kohli to drop him and bring mayank in his place. And today you all are backing Rahul again. Test matches is totally different and in this format players like Sehwag Shaw, Vihari, should be backed.  I am neither defending shaw nor hiding gill's ability. Gill is a long run batsman. Personally I like gill more but he is better suited as a mid order batsman because he has that ability to play 3-4 sessions!  Ipl was a different ball game, and if you talk about newzealand tour, every indian batsman struggled. Shaw had a half century in 4 innings. Windy Wellington is not an easy ground to bat. And most importantly its his 5th test match and he is just 20, give him some to establish. Everyone knows that jofra archer also can bat but england team will never promote him in any case, still bumrah batting at 3 is ❤️❤️

Idk y none talking Abt the pitch difficult to score wickets falling regularly not fit for test match.thanks to ind cathin aus scored 190+  INDvAUS INDvsAUSTest AUSvIND  Both Cummins and Jo Haze had played in ipl, how beautifully they got length right here unlike in 2018-19.  Not sure about commentators but aus guyz were too good. Pujara"s and Rahane dismissal. And they didn't have much ipl  It is just brilliant spell by JH and PC. Dont think any other team would have fared anything better. Ah yes! Let's start the customary blaming of IPL. INDvsAUS INDvAUS Gosh, Shami hopefully will recover soon. India innings end at 36/9. Hazlewood 8/5, tells everything about Australia bowling. Nagging and made Indian batters play everything INDvAUS INDvsAUS  😂 Hell, whatz happening at Adelaide. 19/6  AUSvIND INDvAUS  Heehe yeah, was just thinking India k overseas Test match aur WorldCup knockout match ab se dekhna he nahi hai.

1st innings lo maadiri defence aadaru wickets paduthunna  Smudge ante entanna This is probably wishful thinking, but looking forward to a dramatic fightback in the next session. AUSvIND We have to give it to them; Cummins and Hazlewood bowled exceptionally well and asked the right questions of the Indian batsmen. AUSvIND Takes a rather special effort to even perform the way our batters did. AUSvIND Will be difficult to move past this. AUSvIND Looking at what Marnus is picking up, Smith might tone his mannerisms down a bit. :D INDvAUS Marnus looks all over the place. INDvAUS A little fuller and straighter might help. INDvAUS Even though the scorecard at the moment may suggest otherwise, the Aussie openers haven't looked and/or been troubled at all. INDvAUS I think one reason why the Aussie quicks were more effective early on was they attacked the stumps far more than their Indian counterparts are doing so at the moment. INDvAUS Not much lateral movement off the deck for Bumrah or Umesh.  Have managed to keep things quiet so far. INDvAUS Who will win the ind vs aus series  INDvAUS PrithviShaw pujara viratkholi PrithviShaw is the weaker version of Afridi.

Tuesday 
Turkey 
WW84 
ZackSnydersJusticeLeague My channel reached the 35 Subscribers Milestone! 🏆 via    Its not time for humour. India must demand Kohli resignation. What a disgrace in his captaincy. Instead of picking Shubhman who was looking solid, he chose underconfident Shaw, which started the collapse. Couldn't wrap up tail quickly. Too many careers destroyed Main toh bhaag raha hoon, Maine toh planning bhi waise kiya hain kohli INDvsAUS   The media and current management feed off each other. To justify their errors or promote a player, long claims such as Sachin,MSD comparison are made. Media scrutinized those decisions. INDvAUS   Said this before, say that again, aamir is the most insecure actor in Bollywood. He just can't act in a film that has a good role for any other actor other than him, be it, villain, supporting actor, even heroine.Ideal cast should be a North, south combo      PrithviShaw again got out due to his technical issue, but, Mayank is also trending. So, reminding again, if not, see twitter, if you score anything less than 100,YOU WILL BE DROPPED.Soft hands,no cheeky singles,no fishing outside off, straight bat, no gap,leave a lot, patience. Dont understand why put so much expectations on young players &amp; bog them down, it happened with Pant, calling him the next MSD, now we are seeing the same thing happen with PrithviShaw. Let him toil in Ranji trophy. More games like this will demoralize him further. INDvAUS Shaw  Thats why one should not attempt cheeky singles in test cricket.    He looks like Raavan Adipurush and has already played a menacing villain to Prabhas   Remember or write it down somewhere, when Rohit returns, you will be dropped. A Mumbai cricketer always gets more chances than any other cricketer than anywhere in the world. Second inns will decide your fate. RememberKarunNair   All the more reason to let him find himself in ranji trophy.  Already lost the game in morning  My dp is for frustration on his sena performance despite being our vice skippy and failing again
Better see my post when i backed him when he ran kohli out  Joccks 8 overseas test loss😱😱😱  Another plastic fan   Bigger question is why even a failed overseas cricketer being given farewell
Biased towards his friend politician kohli  My dp is for frustration on his sena performance despite being our vice skippy and failing again
Better see my post when i backed him when he ran kohli out Better losing with Youngsters like Shaw and Gill than with experienced frauds like Pujji and Rahane Bodied Pans
OK pe aagye Biggggg treat sir.... If your words become true...!!!  In the era of T20 aspiring kids should watch Cheteswar innings... Solid batting faced 100+ balls and still holding strong...!!!

Asa lgta h apunich bagwan h!!   After this match result. Aus 2-0 India. Sad truth !!😟😟 Key findings of medical report of LNJP Hospital in Sant Asharamji Bapu Case:

No Physical Assualt
No Loss of Consciousness
No Bite mark
No penetration
No Abrasion
Hymen intact
No sweating
No Erythema

Clearly, Girl's MedicalReportSaysNoRape.  Do you know about the strongest evidence which proves that Sant Shri Asharamji Bapu is innocent ?

That is the medical report according to which there is no even a scratch on body of so called victim.
MedicalReportSaysNoRape
ThursdayThoughts  Imam bukhari can roam freely inspite of facing several charges and 65 warrants against him. However, hindu saint 
Sant Shri Asharamji Bapu has been sentenced life time imprisonment, while MedicalReportSaysNoRape. Is this the way secularism works?  Media day and night shouted, “ rape...rape”. But the MedicalReportSaysNoRape
Sant Shri Asharamji Bapu at that juncture of 80 years age, it's just unbelievable to have done such crime. This is proven by the girl's medical report in 2013 itself...  Maximum on this trend with ❤️

This is our nation.. this is Hindusthan 💪💪

INDvAUS Adelaide PinkBallTest 19/6 --I had gone to take a dump and returned to see India shitting in their pants! 😯 
INDvAUS Adelaide PinkBallTest collapse  Haha. Yea. I think Ashwin should be bowling now. Left hander in the middle who likes to swing across the line. Bring Ashwin on. 
INDvAUS Adelaide PinkBallTest  Yea. All three we regulation catches. No doubt. No excuse. Just out of curiosity, I want to know if lights played any part.  Yea. I wonder if lights are the reason. But they should be prepared. How many catches are they going to drop? India would have been batting by now had they held on to all the chances.

AUSvIND INDvAUS Hahaha!  _R What's the point. It's not as if there's any accountability associated with such stuff. _90 Yep, and then for some reason he himself forgot that. I am seriously worried...too much happiness at times is dangerous. AUSvIND  The referee has stopped the count at nine. AUSvIND INDvAUS Keeping emotions aside, think not too many teams would have scored more than 100 against this bowling today. Hats off.

Cummins &amp; Hazlewood were magnificent in the Ashes. Smith &amp; Warner were missing in 2018/19, but I personally didn't take credit away from India because they beat Australia with this same bowling attack. It is a magnificent attack.

It shows how important Pujara is to this team.

AUSvIND AUSvsIND INDvAUS _kay Content of the highest quality.  🎣🎣🎣 @_itsashleeee_ He could outscore India's second innings! Imagine if Joe Burns outscores India's second innings.

AUSvIND AUSvsIND INDvAUS India lost 16/92 since that run out. Has to be one of the biggest batting turning points ever.

AUSvIND The innings finishes at 36. India's lowest score ever.

Yes or no?   Respect one of the greatest Barcelona defender.   Idk I'm not koeman.
But some journalist did say exact same thing what koeman said today in pc    Good reply for factual information.    Journalists and coach himself said same thing.

Shut up..rahane is one of the best player in test..just because he runout Kohli you guys are asking to sack him..what if he scored century in next inning?you guys will praise him like hell..get rid of this Indian mentality of judging a player  with one match..be sensible _sidharth _chemistry He done only one thing wrong in match..that's only kohli's runout.. please don't hate someone like hell Dekho rahane nahi hota ye bhi catch drop hota Kohli fans.. But their fan want him to take him retirement and even some wants him die.. I'm having a tooth removed today and even THAT will hurt lesser than this batting collapse

INDvAUS Kya se kya ho gaya  More than willing to start a crowdfund for his ticket... Hell, we'll make it business class...  Shaw ke saath settled XI kaha...

Shaw ka defence is worse than Umesh and Bumrah  53 ka lead is not enough to cover the failures of Shaw, Rahane and Vihari

Guaranteed failures hai ye 3

Yes it is ... Result of sticking to basics... Considering current situation IND in first inn lead of 100+ would have been very crucial , had ind not dropped half a dazon catches INDvAUS    Hamesha jaadu ki umeed bhi acchi nahi hai sir, need to fix the basics  What is india's lowest total and what's the record    wht is lowest innings score , I think Ind is going to make that record today INDvAUS  Yeah...

It’s ok Indian fans.
sometimes you thrash teams and sometimes you get thrashed. 
Sometimes you are brave enough to score 600 and give follow on to Aussies. sometimes you score just 36 runs in an inning. 
It’s ok. India will come back stronger. I have faith in our team. 
INDvsAUS  _richter   We can score more than 600 runs in Aus and give them follow on. Thanks to 🌧 otherwise they would have lost to us by inning margin. We are the only Asian side to win test series in Aus. Such collapse can’t have impact on the Indian fans unless we stop thrashing teams like this.    Why? Because Yuvraj hit 36 runs in an over?  Mujhe ye hi laga. 
But phir jab aage padha “in Australia” toh confuse hua. Because we are actually the only Asians to do so (win a test series in Australia)
If you would have said to win BGT toh clear hota.  Ye toh aisa hua ki England are the only one who have won Ashes. Because Ashes bas woh hi khel sakte hain. 
But yes we are only one (from aisa) to win “test series” in Australia.  Bhai BGT toh khelte hi ham hai. 😂 
Han but we are only Asians to win series in Australia. _balnad 😂 86 more runs needed to win Happy Birthday Ricky Pointing Sir.

He didn't appreciate my cricket posts. Only reason I can think off. Let me rephrase, I buy a lot of superhero action figures. I buy a lot of this stuff, but this one is too morbid even for my liking. 🤐   Lol. I just didn't bother with private law till date. Making an effort to change that but the problem I think I have is, I get the article, but too many terms and illustrations that I don't which take away understanding the nuances.   I am aware that even this has sizable enrollment because I know someone who did this. Not the bulk of the numbers but it adds up.

  Agreed, sir. India went up against a triumvirate of fast bowlers comprising the World's No. 1 Test bowler, a pacer whose pink-ball record is immaculate and another fast bowler, who has occasionally drawn parallels with McGrath. That's some serious threat right there! During an interview with Mitchell Starc in early August, I had asked him how Australia plans on combatting India's batting?
His answer: “By sticking to the basics, bowling in partnerships, backing our plans and building pressure." Well... they just did that and more AUSvINDtest  Gripping read, Ben. Do you think Ashwin's away form in Tests, early in his career, had anything to do with Dhoni's captaincy in five-day cricket? To what extent does that impact performance,if at all I remember watching Agarwal at the nets in Cuttack during Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 after the 2018-19 tour. Agarwal wouldn't settle for anything less than a four during the simulation face-offs. Karnataka staff kept raising bar, he kept meeting the goals. Shaw needs that hunger /focus As difficult a time as this is for Prithvi Shaw, feel he should have a chat with his opening partner Mayank Agarwal about the travails of getting into the Indian XI, the domestic grind that went into it and how Agarwal dealt with selectors overlooking him. Critical phase for Shaw  The next Tendulkar and all ... Don't want to be uncharitable but the guy needs to do what Mayank did - spend two solid seasons at the domestic level, away from the spotlight Bumrah has faced more deliveries this innings than both of Shaw's innings put together. AUSvIND Indian fast bowlers troubling Australian batsmen in Australia. As a 90s kid, I surely didn't grow up seeing a lot of this. Glad adulthood is different!

INDvsAUS Unacceptable INDvAUS Exactly my thoughts too.. not upto this level ... atleast for now   It may sound harsh but he doesn't belong to international level.. not only here but on NZ and in Dubai for IPL.. need to pick a solid opener i would say to an extent like a Murali Vijay mould Kohli and team management have to be responsible for Shaw's flop... Why pick a batsman who is out of form actually looks like he don't belong to this level INDvsAUS  And all-out _Krishna It might be possible if rohit were captain. 😉  When modi ji will crash?

Where do I buy homing pigeons?  _  Agreed. The annual figures must add up to 100. There’s data missing.  Ok so I’ve managed to read your excellent paper, Prof - any reason SMR is not calculated for professions other than “farmer”? That would certainly provide data for a valid inter-profession comparison. Perhaps I’m missing the nuances of data aggregation in this field.  ie: there is a higher number of individuals who identify as house wives than those who identify as farmers, that’s why there’s a higher ratio of house wives who commit suicide, than farmers. Would a per capita number be more appropriate for comparison?(Asking with utmost respect)  By no means am I discounting the research &amp; I acknowledge I know nothing about this field - I’m just a dude on the internet. Out of curiosity :
If my above assumption is correct then is it fair to compare the two data points? Aren’t these ratios a function of population?  Prof, thanks for enlightening us. Could you (or someone reading this) kindly share the paper this image is extracted from? I’m confused about the data. Are these % of total suicides per annum? eg in ‘02, out of all suicides, 20% were house wives?

ROAR LIKE RUBINA ROAR LIKE RUBINA   Drown in the sadness of this match, no motivation to do anything else also tbh  _Chopernos Cummins is 5-10 Ks faster though, and has a better short ball _141 Not with three bowlers, and Umesh as our second best. Need 5/15 type from Bumrah We lost the match, the series, our second best fast bowler, and the will to watch cricket in 1.5 hrs 😪 INDvAUS One of those sessions that can decide the series - unless somehow we get 70/80 more. We had our chances - 180/3 before runout, 111/7 before 80 more runs, and we should have dominated then. This might be 2011 all over again after Virat leaves

INDvAUS  Thank you, you are really good at this :D Yaaaaaar how do you give Labuschagne two chances this early after losing 56-7

INDvAUS  Oh didn't know about iDeal, just checked and it is super interesting :D

Here, we have to choose btw credit, debit card, UPI, e-wallets, net banking or even BNPL now - we all have our preferences but retailer based rewards etc make the decision tough at times tbh  somewhere in there there is a product idea to build a chrome plugin that takes all your payment details and auto selects a payment option on the checkout. Too many options, and selecting the best payment option for that retailer will be a problem by the looks of it. JaspritBumrah Night Watchman😉

The amount of contribution  has done in increasing awareness about Hindu temples is just amazing. Feels good to see an old friend bring out the best about Hinduism.

indvsaus2020 BCCI ICC     150 ચાન્સ મળ્યાં તો પણ લબુશેન 50 નાં કરી શક્યો.

ભારતને પુરે પુરા ચાન્સ છે કે 80-90 રનની લીડ લઈ શકે.

INDvAUS જ્યારે ભારત ૧૮૮/૩ ની મજબૂત પોઝિશન માં હતું ત્યારે લાગતું હતું કે પૂજારાની મેરેથોન ઇન્નિંગ કામ લાગી પરંતુ આજે જે રીતે આપણે પાણી માં બેઠા છે એ જોતાં લાગે છે કે ટેસ્ટ સીરીઝ માટે આપણે રેડી નથી

INDvAUS ભારત અને ઓસ્ટ્રેલિયા વચ્ચેની પ્રથમ ટેસ્ટની પ્રથમ ઈનિંગ્સમાં ભારત 2️⃣4️⃣4️⃣ રનનો સ્કોર કરીને ઓલઆઉથ થયું છે. ભારત તરફથી માત્ર કેપ્ટન વિરાટ કોહલીએ ફિફ્ટી ફટકારવામાં સફળ રહ્યો હતો.

indvsaus2020    ભારત અને ઓસ્ટ્રેલિયા વચ્ચેની પ્રથમ ડે નાઈટ ટેસ્ટમાં ભારતે પ્રથમ બેટિંગનો નિર્ણય કર્યો છે. પરંતુ લંચ બ્રેક સુધીમાં ભારતના ઓપનિંગ બેટ્સમેન પેવેલિયન પહોંચી ચુક્યા છે. ભારત પ્રથમ ઈનિંગ્સમાં કેટલા રનનો સ્કોર ખડકી શકશે?

India were 29-7 against 'Srilanka' in December 2017. 
Guess who was the captain?
Rohit Sharma.
Dhoni saved India from humiliation then.    For some strange reason only Shaw and Saha are being targetted after this disaster. Overseas specialist Rahane somehow seems to get away with the criticism every single time. Poor from Kohli as well. AUSvsIND INDvAUS Agree 100%. Never got his due as a good Test Batsman.  Very Ordinary bowling from Umesh and Bumrah. If it was 99-00, Srinath would have picked up Slater and Blewett by now. AUSvsIND Please retire out yourself Burns.

INDvsAUS AUSvsIND AUSvsIND Kohli _kannan This is actually kind of mixed feeling. It's both funny and tragic at the same time.

If you want some distraction from the cricket, here are some FPL tips if you are looking to make last-minute changes. 

 AUSvIND 

Watch (if you have the heart): India blown away by Australia for 36/9 at Adelaide Oval

  Although I do feel this attack has gone from strength-to-strength since. Cummins &amp; Hazlewood were magnificent in the Ashes. Smith &amp; Warner were missing in 2018/19, but I personally didn't take credit away from India because they beat Australia with this same bowling attack. It is a magnificent attack.

It shows how important Pujara is to this team.

AUSvIND AUSvsIND INDvAUS _kay Content of the highest quality.  🎣🎣🎣 @_itsashleeee_ He could outscore India's second innings! Imagine if Joe Burns outscores India's second innings.

AUSvIND AUSvsIND INDvAUS India lost 16/92 since that run out. Has to be one of the biggest batting turning points ever.

AUSvIND The innings finishes at 36. India's lowest score ever. 

Further salt in the wounds for India as Shami looks to have a serious injury.

AUSvIND AUSvsIND INDvAUS PrithviShaw goes for duck - scam 2020
How tf they picked him over the consistent shubhman gill 😳
INDvAUS   _lenglet  we r gonna concede one Pedri would have been given standing ovation for his effort off the post.. if there were fans in stadium. This guy is fuckin insane 💙❤️
BarcaRealSociedad     Dont compare them...different positions..pedri is generational...both are good at same time.    Finally a good game...pls bring in riqui puig Frenkie strikes and we are in the lead ...should have scored 5 goals by now...missed easy chances
BarcaRealSociedad  

Another one ...just few mins back...was watching the game live ..then saw ur tweet. ₹90.34  And when he gets out on duck ,there is a bit of ishant as well 😂 Shaw starc INDvAUS   She saves 4 runs at the boundary line was just outstanding and that catch of  Rodrigues was also a great take Sad thing is this score has given enough confidence for burns to burn us even further! RubItIn     RetiredOut Hopefully this will not be recorded as TeamIndia lowest total. AUSvsIND INDvAUS How crucial are those catches? Butterfinger How crucial was that runout? Opening flamboyant vs resilience... Disastrous tour this far... AUSvsIND INDvAUS   PrithviShaw well justified to be rotated. He needs longer run in domestic... I see more overconfidence!   AUSAvINDA INDvsAUS  PrithviShaw over ShubhmanGill defies logic! INDvAUS AUSvIND    Sorry in office calls currently. DND 2.0 is a poorly rated app, so not installing that. My  is on DND anyways. Hoping action is taken. Call came in at 11.33 AM on 15th Dec. They don't have a clue who they are calling, asking if I own a car which is up for sale. _India  calls from  cars for sale 095208 99467, random number calling inspite of DND

Soliciting from personal  Positive side of lockdown, lower pollution levels be it air or water!  Unfriendly Ghosts on the Sydney dance floor INDvsAUS AUSAvIND commentary is also not helping, ear twitching 😒, guess we will need to deal with someone through this series  _India  DND 2.0 app at Google play store with 1.9 / 5 review! How do we expect anyone to install and trust? No one is responding to those critical reviews   Damn. If what Dushyant Dave is saying is true it's pretty dangerous. He says PILs were deliberately being filed in SC during CAA, NRC, Farmers protests and migrants issue so that government could use the SC to defend itself. SupremeCourt farmersrprotest TooMuchDemocracy  Pujara is the man to watch out for this series. Probably the most solid batsman in the Indian Test team. Going to be a very interesting series. 
INDvAUS pujara Kohli india Cricket test TestCricket      His work for the party is appreciated but after a certain point people get frustrated and leave. In a way it's good he left now and not before 2022 elections. 
Party is now strengthening itself from the grassroot level which is good.     He didn't like when AAP members from Delhi came to support the party. He felt they are dominating him.....so got angry and left. 
And after he left for the first AAP won a seat in Goa and bettered its vote share. Now AAP is growing super fast in Goa and looking to perform well.     Nope. He left AAP and AAP opened its account in Goa with a Zilla Parishad seat.  Just like Banglore and Gujarat. It'll be nice if you guys can build an Aam Aadmi Clinic in Bernaulim. Just hit my mind now.  Dhoni captaincy is not about INDIVIDUAL

Surgery to replace part of cheek and jaw and radiotherapy got rid of the cancer. 

Now me and my stick blender are very happy together 🍐🍇🍉🍏🥭🥐🥖🥨🍕🥪🍨🍧=🥫🍜   Would u blv b4 this hit out of left field last year I could have said the same abt me. 

Very rare instances of being sick even with the sniffles

And then, wham!! The big C

Life, what can you do but live it eh?   Your visualisation helped with my radiotherapy as well. I always imagined the radiation attacking my cancer cells exactly like this. 💜 This immediately made me think of the part in Down to Agincourt where Castiel describes Dean’s immune system fighting Croatoan

“An army unseen but vast, its numbers beyond counting, has just picked up their swords.”

   Well i must admit I’ve owned one of those models for years and it’s a wild ride....  Great thread explaining the Covid19 vaccine and how it functions

   💯  💯  Lol..never   Okay. But first of all you need to pull it out from your ass  You need treatment   Lower the volume of panelists and then screaming like innocent doesn't make u right. "Zor zor se chillane se jhoot sach nahi hota" Isne to 130 crore Indians  ki baja di, fir wo 11 Australians kya cheej hai iske liye. Why did Ravi Shastri miss this player ? INDvsAUSTest  Biggest mistake by Ravi Shastri, he shouldn't have skipped these legends in Team India. INDvsAUSTest  Team India is so smart. They knew that Indians have to go to office before 11:00 am. Special thanks to Shami.

India have lost the perfect chance to win the test match. Without these two the future sure does look grim at the moment for the rest of the series. The lead would've been more than 130 had we not dropped catches Match ending today😢😢😢 Australia have literally just destroyed India 😢 Predicting big runs from mayank Aggarwal and virat kohli today.
INDvsAUS 
movingday  Preach  If india want to secure a draw atleast we need to bat for atleast a day and a half probably till twilight of the 4th day. India need a lead of about 400+ to secure a draw or a win. Predicting a big innings from Mayank and Kohli. Haven't seen something as true as this.  Bumrah and Hardik are the only good thing that mumbai Indians have done. You could almost ignore their toxic fanbase because of these two.  Ram square   Go Goa Maguva 🙄     Went to the hospital to see the Doctor for routine consultation came back and saw TeamIndia scorecard. Now i desperately need a glass, some ice and tonic water, the rest would manage.
INDvAUS INDvsAUSTest PinkBallTest IndianCricketTeam 
horror Don't know what would be the result with this PinkBallTest but TeamIndia would miss ViratKohli from 2nd test onwards very badly. Australia know from within they wouldn't have anyone in the opposition to look into their eyes.   And Bumrah at the crease looks better than wade. AUSvIND Cricket  Atleast better than Freelanka team who usually tour India for free vacations.  Get hammered 🔨 and.d go back   Correct   😂 Khatam Tata Bye Bye

INDvsAUS AUSvsIND TestCricket    _vohra  I am not saying anything about his technique but yeah he definately need to work on his mindset eveyone one has a weakness but how you can encounter that what matters the most. He got talent and he is getting opportunity he just need to give himself more time.  _vohra  He is just playing with attacking mindset. He is still in the T20 zone even in pratice matche he was only playing one way  Bumrah bats sensibly then Shami and Yadav. This is a good move given the last few over were challenging and bumrah played well. He even make sure agarwal was off the strike.     Kal Instagram crash ho gya tha...

Besides faulty loyalty, they are also bad business managers.  Asking for Khalistan is separating a state from India. Whereas, Hindu Rashtra contemplates assimilating more territory into the Indian Union. Difference is that of secessionist vs expansionist respectively. Constitution prohibits the first &amp; allows the second under article 2 &amp; 3. Pujara has Rahul Dravid written all over him.
 INDvAUS   Abe yr 😂😂😂😂  😂😂😂😂😂🔥 INDvAUS AUSvIND PinkBallTest

TeamIndia were bowled out for 36. Their previous lowest ever total in a test innings was 42 made against England at Lord’s in 1974😱 

Watch how the horror unfolded on Saturday morning- 👇

 AUSvIND INDvAUS

Australia start the second session on a bright note, hitting three boundaries in three overs. 

The hosts need 51 more runs to win.

 The start date of the main draw of AusOpen was originally slated for January 18 and organisers have been locked in negotiations with the local government over COVID-19 health protocols.

 INDvAUS 

It was not less than a nightmare to watch Australia taking 5/4 in a 35-ball spell on Day 3 of the pink-ball Test at Adelaide on Saturday.

 INDvAUS 

India's earlier lowest score was 42 at the Lord's in 1974 against England, known in Indian cricket parlance as "Summer of 42".

 Spurs had just 24 percent of the ball and 19 passes in the final third compared to Liverpool’s 200 but Mourinho insisted the better team had lost

 ViratKohli is gone as well! 😱 This is a shocker on a Saturday! 

TeamIndia - 19/6

Raahi -  तुमको देखें या देखें हम काम तुम्हारा ||

@__raahi__  ghazal POEMS    Nehra categorically said, he looks fine to him to play. Obviously he was taking about competitive game.
Do you mean Ishant should come back after performing in domestic? He was not dropped due to performance and has best stats in tests esp in Aus __ _ If you ask fans on twitter...they'd love to see Rahane retiring tomorrow  or even better if it was in 2015-16. Can't respect a player averaging 45+ in overseas. As if they have 6 more batsman with better record.   Heard Nehra saying that he has seen  Ishant bowling long spells in the nets and he looks fine to him to play. And he can't understand why he is not called up for the upcoming tests.

 Will be greatly missed!  Dhawan deserved to be dropped...murali vijay unfairly dropped for Dhawan only. And no.
Dhawan or Murali hasn't played any inning like Rahane.
What about Rahane totally forgotten in ODIs even when we have continuous failures at no 4. Much better than most of them Ashwin scoring a 50 today   Spot on!
Rahane fans can relate the most  Rohit shouldn't even be considered in tests at this age and with such fragile fitness esp age. When we are sidelining much younger players like KL Rahul or Nair who has potential to play 3-4 years what's the use of it
When they can forget Rahane in ODIs why not Rohit in tests   Okay. There I agree. With big scores it sounds like 200s. Yes he can be more consistent with 80-100s. But still we all knows he is a special batsman esp overseas and deserves to be captain after Kohli. 👍  Bhai masti bohot Kar liya ab Gill ko Lao. Shaw se Nahi hoga. INDvAUS Cricket Grazie Seb. Grazie Mille!❤️  _nv   Please, Jose was always criticising our players. Who did we even have then. Jones, smalling, Valencia and young as our back 4. Fellaini, pereira and lingard lol _nv   And jose said that it was one of his greatest achievements to get that squad to second place. Imagine a treble winning manager saying that. 

Translation - He somehow got shit to second place. 

That same shit got him sacked. More power to you, Demba. SayNoToRacism  Very very happy for Checo

Happy Birthday to Aussie legend .

OnThisDay 

  don't wake up to watch the match early, simple as that :D  nobody can  say that to him, can we  ?  
Atleast it will expose a fraud called Rahane in the team, his last test 100 in SENA was in 2014 &amp; he makes sure that by playing 2 quota innings here &amp; there nobody will notice him .. _Hitwicket With Shami gone it doesn't even matter who plays...
They have no chance @ picking 20 for the rest of the series.......
Worse Bumrah can come up with a bad back if continue to burden himself alone &amp; we might see Umesh-Siraj-Saini in action @ some point of time...  They should come home with Kohli.. What hurts more than the score is -  Shami's injury...
The last thing we needed, imagine the pressure on Bumrah for the next couple tests bowling on flatter wickets, they will grind us to dust &amp; smash left, right &amp; centre with the bowling 🤦 AUSvIND INDvAUS _Hitwicket Pujara goes missing in the 2nd innings, so take him out as well... Hopefully Virat Kohli take his boys along with him back to  India, anyways it's going to be 4-0... 
Atleast this will save them from further embaressments.. INDvAUS AUSvIND It's official now as the BCCI spokesperson has spoken, Prithvi Shaw is getting dropped for the 2nd test.. 😏   _Hitwicket  AUSvIND INDvAUS    goodluck, girl! idk- raat ki batein Sir bhool jaate hain saverey ko.😂  virat sir, pehle character ko redeem karaa lijkye baad mein aapse baatcheet hogi.

And what tales they have spun!  👌🏽🤛🏼    i just looked up the story of the bengali show! Extremely offputting. Yuck! bhabhiji doesnt let them live in peace until the last epi it seems.    No no no bhabhiji ab Virat sir ke dil par ghar kar gayi- aise kaise Sai ke dil ? Jahaan aged, sorry mature cheese hai, wahan Sai kya cheez hai!

 Fantastic first spell by  it's a dream spell for every classical off spinner. Hopefully he can continue his momentum in entire series. 

AUSvIND INDvsAUS      is going home next week, but  wouldn't want to return to India without the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after that run out.🤭

On a serious note I think that run out impact his concentration.

 AUSvIND 

Watch (if you have the heart): India blown away by Australia for 36/9 at Adelaide Oval

   Getting more and more curious about the challenge. The build up is quite interesting 😉🙂 First Dinner Break in a Test match. Nice to see the plain white clothed classic cricket at a lush green ground. The pink ball is clearly more visible on screen.  Wish Border and Gavaskar would do the commentary together. BorderGavaskarTrophy  INDvAUS  Worth the Tea-thing trouble. 🍵 🍵 It's getting cold. Better to stay inside n cosy !!!   So be it an individual or an ultra huge organization it all boils down to the fear of physical attacks. Humanizing eh..in its true sense !!! How much does India amount to in terms of Business ? Follow me I will follow back

ROAR LIKE RUBINA ROAR LIKE RUBINA   Unbelievable. I know they were bowling well and all but we needed atleast one player to grind in and they all collapsed.
Threw away a solid win going into the series.  I’m more concerned about the fielding coach and his role. 🙄  Absolutely ridiculous. The match was in our hands. 😂😂😂😂   🤣🤣🤣 Umesh 50?

AUSvsIND Saha needs to do a Paine here.

INDvsAUS Kohli takes a blinder of Green.
Green returns the favour.

INDvsAUS  The scorecard reads 15-5 but its actually 15-4 guys. Relax. One was Bumrah. 🙄

INDvsAUS “Dabba leke line me khade hai “

AUSvIND INDvAUS  Tim paine was dropped by Mayank Agarwal

AUSvIND INDvsAUS   May be the current fielding coach is Ravi Shasthri’s friend. This adelaid test match will be remembered for the insane number of dropped catches by the Indian Team. 

 AUSvIND INDvAUS Somebody should be made accountable and answerable for India’s fielding woes. 

 AUSvIND INDvAUS  Talk about India’s bowling also.  The line "Agar aap double ande ka egg roll nai khate ..to aap mere dost nai"
Brings and east to west 😃 🙂 smiles on.
Lip smacking 😋 _BT  U're an Idiot..if you think so...

Chill! There's a lot of murmur about Kohli taking a paternity leave after this first test. What if the baby is delivered overseas in 🇦🇺.🤔
This way he'll shut all the blabbering mouths and the baby too will be a  PIO/NRI + he'll play all d games.
What say        I can buy even plain white test jersey if Dhoni wears that
MSDhoni Just played the MismatchedQuiz and I got 8 answers right! I’m a champ at knowing what friends really want to say . Try it now!    Check stats before you open up on something!

 Ravi shastri praising prithvi shaw... INDvAUS  Why is there is 2 ball delay in ur live feed on the Sony liv mobile app even for a premium subscriber? Worst is that u can see the scorecard which is ahead of the live feed.. SonyLIV  despite the iit cases, chennai total cases are 344;  Saha is the 1st choice wkt keeper, so guess its good to go with the 1st choice.  Selection on expected lines. Shaw over gill is the talking point. To have saini/ siraj as 4th seamer for a 1st test in Australia is a huge gamble. Ashwin any day.  Unless kohli has other ideas and puts kl Rahul as opener ahead of all..  4 seamers haven't always been successful for india. Ashwin must be in the 11 _10 vennila veliye varuvala... _10 hasili fisili _10 oru ooril from kaakha kaakha.. "aval puramaai!" NOT OUT! Replays show that Burns got an inside edge.

INDvAUS AUSvIND AUSvsIND AUSvINDtest   This might help.  Shaw was the night watchman who came to protect opener Bumrah.
INDvAUS AUSvIND  Varun looks more like Shaw Top-order conundrum continues for the Indian Test squad. This is what happens when there is no compulsion for Indian players (unlike their English/Australian counterparts) to play domestic leagues like Ranji Trophy. IPL stats cannot be the basis for Test selection.

INDvAUS I see enough unnecessary hate against Kohli on Twitter. Trolls suddenly turn into selection experts whenever India loses under him, but suddenly the whole "team" gets the credit if India wins.

Let him be himself.

Not everyone has to act like Dravid or Dhoni.  Zero cost, ease of use (no app required), professional and modern feel, good user experience, high participants limit, add-ons and integrations, etc.

Skype seems more like a social messaging platform with video calling feature. Not the best model to crack corporate customers.  Ironic how many of the EdTech Founders resort to childish tactics themselves to "educate" kids.  I have always admired the way you think. Truly miss your posts on LinkedIn.

He got talent and he is getting opportunity he just need to give himself more time.  _vohra  He is just playing with attacking mindset. He is still in the T20 zone even in pratice matche he was only playing one way  Bumrah bats sensibly then Shami and Yadav.

No, because we are so busy earning our living there is no time to protest, our loans are not waived off and we thrive to earn more to pay high income taxes and then high GST to run this country. God bless! CaptainAdaniNaal FarmersProtests Does anyone support working salaried class in this country? Answer is no, because none of them have time to protest against such high income taxes they pay and their earnings are taxed up with higher GST taxes when they spend already taxed money   One more thing Goenka sir, How did corporate tax cut to 15% help Indian economy apart from helping few rich corporates who didn't give raises even with almost zero operarational cost due to work from home? New income tax regime was even more dangerous than old, Jumla as always?   Goenka sir, I disagree, Urban people salaried class are made to pay enough taxes, they should get free vaccine as they run the GDP of this country, It is not that difficult to be poor in this country, you just dont have to work thats it. All great guns were created on same day, Rajni Sir, Yuvraj Singh, and You, Proof that God creates great individuals in batches ;)  We know that kiddo.

Surgery to replace part of cheek and jaw and radiotherapy got rid of the cancer. 

Now me and my stick blender are very happy together 🍐🍇🍉🍏🥭🥐🥖🥨🍕🥪🍨🍧=🥫🍜   Would u blv b4 this hit out of left field last year I could have said the same abt me. 

Very rare instances of being sick even with the sniffles

And then, wham!! The big C

Life, what can you do but live it eh?   Your visualisation helped with my radiotherapy as well. I always imagined the radiation attacking my cancer cells exactly like this. 💜 This immediately made me think of the part in Down to Agincourt where Castiel describes Dean’s immune system fighting Croatoan

“An army unseen but vast, its numbers beyond counting, has just picked up their swords.”

   Well i must admit I’ve owned one of those models for years and it’s a wild ride....  Great thread explaining the Covid19 vaccine and how it functions

INDvsAUS AUSvIND  What an excellent morning it is turning out to be for Australia. India six down now for just 19 on the board with Pujara, Rahane and now Kohli- the backbone of Indian batting line up- back in the pavilion.

 SakhirGP  We get it representing 1.2 billion people means nothing to you innit? May as well extend your fixing league upto 24 teams and play for 365 days you utter greedy bastards  

AUSvIND Pujara getting out early will be pretty much game over, you can't expect kolly to bail out every O.S tours about time for nohanae to step up this is his third OZ tour ffs

AUSvIND Tail ender's B-I-A-T-C-H  May sound superstitious, but ICT and LFC has done extraordinary things whenever i opted to not follow due to work/disinterest/sleep.
Prime ex. Trentbridge 2018 (basically whole test leg),perth day 2,MCG day 1, barca home UCL so might be tempted to not follow next day. 

AUSvIND  Mayank should be backed for all 4 tests imo  You thunk we could whitewash poms on lifeless chepauk and ahamedabad drop in pitches? LMFAO  Boria ManCuMdar told shaw is an incumbent opener so he should play atleast next test on today's show mf basically an unofficial bcci member so..  But bcci would go with shaw as an opener and lolhul at 4 due to ExPeRiEnCe SCENARIO 1:
P Shaw to open in MCG with gill batting at 6 and Vihari at 4.
SCENARIO 2:
Vihari opening with gill at 6 and Lolhul at 4
SCENARIO 3:
Lolhul opening with gill at 6
You can't expect a debutant to open against best pace attack in world as simple as that  

AUSvIND In all fairness, Rofat Sharma could have been in this situation, with the help of PR mf escaped from scrutiny in the name of obesity as injury dfkm

AUSvIND indvsausT20 viratkholi  check for any new work needed and get it done on time."

I went to the other room and shed a few tears before I went back and agreed to this "condition".

I am still not ready to believe this actually happened but it did!

Pune Dentist PreventiveDentistry Ethics patientfirst you for me but on one condition."

I braced myself for what was to follow. But she stumped me. She said:

"I will get the treatment done if you promise to call me every 6 months and make me come in for a regular maintenance visit so we can keep an eye on all the work done and and truly is interested in her patient's well being. 

I have asked the patient to pass on my compliments to her previous dentist and asked her to call me in case she wishes to discuss what we are doing for her. 

Then she said "I will get whatever is the best option according to And in case you are nervous about seeing someone else, I will come with you to comfort you during your treatment."

I was stunned but mighty impressed with the dentist for this. She not only is well aware of her limitations and works within those, she is extremely conscientious would like to proceed. But first she told me why her dentist did not do the same work which I have recommended. 

She said "My dentist was very clear. She said that the treatment that you need is quite complex and I don't do that level of work. You should find someone who does. Basically she has gotten one tooth treated at a time and ended up with a bunch of fillings on her teeth. Over time, she now has more fillings than sound teeth in her mouth and needs crowns on all of them. 

We discussed multiple options and she came today to decide which way she I had a very interesting experience with a patient today. 

She was brought to us by an old family friend who considers my dad to be her foster dad. Like she literally drove her over. 

This patient has been seeing a dentist for almost a decade and has had a lot of work done.  I think every Indian fan was dreading the inevitable long tail!  I am rooting for him to succeed more than I ever rooted for anyone else but he is not helping matters. 

He needs to move into the NCA and become Rahul Dravid's shadow. 

We don't want him to be lost like one of your Mumbai teammates was. You know whom I am referring to!  I don't think that's a fair statement Jatin. 

The failed drug test, the Tik Tok videos, and then being bowled as Ricky Ponting predicted it while dropping a sitter.

I think that's more than one ball. 

Also reports (unconfirmed of course) about off the field issues. Time to grind out and bat long to set the right tone for rest of the tour. INDvAUS Amazing finishing🙌      Yes, it was Gilly.. Isn't this the reason we start playing the game first of all, that pure love with the very sport and that's what this great sportsman represented. Rest in Peace Legend. Maradona   Why not have win percentage as ranking criteria, much better than point percentage because in that system each game will have relevance but in this point percentage significance of each game will massively reduce if its a big series.

Better cooperation between Foreign Ministry, ASSOCHAM and Ministry of Trade &amp; Commerce is the need of the hour: PM   The world believes in the Indian economy today. During the pandemic, the entire world was worried about investments. However, India saw record FDI and FPI.

You've a lot of opportunities of investment in every sector in India, today.

We should keep a profit-centric approach and make it purpose-oriented, making it more integrated with the society.

    Yes, they shouldn't have bowled good lines and lengths so that our rockstars could score a mountain of runs and shastri and co. could go around blowing their trumpet that this is the best touring side india has ever had.   We were completely exposed in NZ, and  it's been ages since we won in England. Every time we have some or the other excuse - lost tosses, one bad session, etc. What we simply won't admit is that our batting isn't world class.   No amount of good bowling can justify a score of 15/6 for a side, which claims to be the best in the world. The batting has been mediocre for a while now. And it's particularly tragic given that this is probably the best bowling attack that we have ever had.     Looking at this batting order, I would say lessons can't be learnt even after being handed repeated spankings in multiple games overseas.  I'm kind of happy with this. If Kohli and Shastri aren't held accountable for this mess, then i dont know what it will take to address the gaping holes in our batting lineup. In other news, Indian bowlers take a cue from their Pak counterparts - start picking up wickets lbw since the fielders refuse to catch anything.

INDvAUS If India can hold Australia to less than 300 in this first innings then they have a good chance. But they need to bowl out of their skins for that to happen
INDvAUS  I think the lack of a solid fifth bowling option will make a huge difference here. The oz bowlers were fresh even after 80 overs. Indian bowlers won't have that luxury.  Plus we are a bowler short. I just hope this isn't one of those "gets better to bat with each passing innings" pitches. Bcoz our batting first is the only small positive we have right now.  As unlikely as it looks to me right now, I really hope you're right buddy, and our bowlers keep us in the game.  She is a veryyy strong woman!! And the way she handles everything without making it a mudda unlike others is mind-blowing.She speaks on the right time where needed! More power girl!

Only way to come out of this absurdity is bounce the Aussies out. Getting 5-6 wicket in chase of 90 is only way to get confidence back in the series.

Onus once again falls on bowlers. Hopefully, they can make a match out of it. INDvAUS 

Why India falters in high pressure situation is intriguing. They always falter in big matches, important knock out matches. Team management should look into it or maybe team management is solely responsible for this. INDvAUS 

This is lowest total by India in Test Cricket. This kind preposterous show when all you needed is a bit of grit &amp; determination is appalling.
This kind of batting scars team mentally. I will be surprised if India makes a comeback from here.

AUSAvIND  Neither the Shaw nor the Saha selection has worked for TeamIndia 
This test is far from done, but already curious to know how India pick for the next game.

Back at Adelaide in 2018, AUS bottom 5 made 115 versus TeamIndia 
Now this test rests on how India conquer one of their weaknesses overseas.
AUSvIND INDvAUS AUSvsIND INDvsAUS Started so well at Edgbaston in 2018, equally impressive at Adelaide later that year, but couldn't quite keep that going through the rest of those series.

Augurs so well for the rest of this AUSvIND series &amp; moreso in the absence of Kohli for the rest of it 
AUSvsIND INDvAUS TeamIndia 50 for Kohli. Always a determined batsman. Knowing that he's got just 1 test to contribute would have fortified his focus further. He would want to win this on his own. A classy bowling opposition to contend with though. Ah, test match cricket....

However he was an outstanding slip fielder and useful leg-break bowler too.  The youngest England captain to score 100 is Alastair Cook  who was 25y 77d when he scored 173 v Bangladesh at Chittagong on 12/13 March (158* at close of 12 March) 2010.  At the other end of the scale Tatenda Taibu is the youngest Test captain to score a 100 when he made 153 v Bangladesh at Dhaka on 17 January 2005 aged 21y 248d.  Working-class men, in the borough constituencies, were first enfranchised in 1867. It was non-householders, of all social groups, who were not responsible for paying rates to the local authority who were disenfranchised until 1918, probably about 5.4m men.  Do we live in a free society or not? Allowing people to take personal responsibility for Christmas and everything else may have some downsides but it is wholly superior to how affairs are managed in Russia or China.  Problem is there is no vacancy at the moment and, secondly, Islington North will disappear anyway once long-postponed redistribution of constituencies boundaries is completed.   Most of them are already there! _maasi  _pitkar He is in every sense prodigy of Steve Smith  Guess the jinx is still working.. take care tomorrow  Cc: Prithvi Shaw  If i have met a person once..

 The Melbourne Renegades’ use of the X-factor substitute blew up in their faces on Saturday as they slumped to their second consecutive loss to the Hobart Hurricanes at Blundstone Arena.

 Cricket Australia were planning to fly Sydney-based Test squad members David Warner and Sean Abbott to Melbourne on Saturday in a bid to avoid them being stranded in the NSW capital for next week's Boxing Day Test if Victoria shuts it border to Sydney. 

 Technology billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes has become the first Australian to own an NBA team, buying a minority stake in the Utah Jazz  It's confirmed: The Australian Open is taking place in February and has been locked in for Melbourne until 2039  On a slow, spongey kind of pitch, with an ominous tendency to bounce unevenly, no Australian top-order batsman produced anything like the assurance of Kohli, Rahane or Pujara.

 UPDATED | India lost the last four wickets of their first innings in 25 balls and the first wicket of their second innings, and between times blasted out Australia for 191.

 Sydney to Hobart Yacht organisers will decide on Saturday morning whether the famous race should be called off for the first time in its 75-year history due to the COVID-19 outbreak in the northern beaches.

 instagramdown  I have experienced losing a close one and I want none to suffer from it, Even if it doesn't work 100% , atleast it gives you hope, Something is better than nothing!!
Having hope only heals you somewhat as you are +ve about it ‼️  Yeah I will be ready to listen in person, There is no such hard and fast rule that a vaccine takes 5-8 yrs , Swine Flu (H1N1) Vaccine took a year only‼️
Now we must stop it over here 
Even if you doubt vaccine, What if a Dr suggests you to take it for someone close in crisis?  I don't even stay in Usa , I lost my grandad due to Covid ,what if any vaccine would have worked for him with 94 - 95% success ,I would have been the world's happiest person rn, I don't need the vaccine but if anyone's family member gets saved by it , the happiness is what I need  Yeah absolutely it's not my expertise it's the trained professionals who have worked behind it if we don't trust each other's profession then we can't evolve as a better society ‼️ cmon bro , this is irrelevant comparison, We don't depend on movies but we depend on our health, Opinion placed to "less" people is okay but not to all always if it's not our expertise ‼️
Let it cool down here , Not here to argue🙏🙏    Never speak something which is not of your expertise, Don't take it in wrong way but it is what it is. If you have opinion keep it limited while discussing something with ur frnds or family , If you tell everyone about it , It shows character,sense etc.

Remember the names of captain and coach 😂🐍🐍 They blamed MS for every poor performance in Aus/Eng/SA.

Bako gaaliyan inko sab

Sab yaad rakha jaata hai💉💉😂😂 AUSvINDtest AUSvIND INDvsAUSTest This test is done and dusted.  and  need to focus on what went wrong in this 1 hour while preparing  for the 2nd Test. With Hazlewood and Cummins in this kinda form, any team would crumble down. AUSvIND INDvAUS   Reality strikes back..When India won back in 2018, there was no Smith in the side and Cummins and Hazlewood were not on this kinda form. Now they are. India staring at a 4-0 Whitewash. AUSvIND INDvsAUS   It's 19 for 6 but Still India can fight back. If Vihari and the rest can raise the score to 150, then 200 is more than enough for the talented Indian bowlers- Shami Bumrah and Ashwin to defeat the Aussies. Let's hope for the best AUSvIND INDvAUS    It's a funny game. Just before 45 minutes Indians were dreaming to win the game. Now they are desperately wanting to save it. AUSvIND INDvAUS    Total bloodbath. 15 for 5. Rahane's record when he is under pressure, in the 2nd innings is very very poor. He has never responded well with a fifty when under pressure.   need to reprimand him for this. AUSvIND INDvAUS With Agarwal and Pujara gone, India in trouble here at 15 for 4. Although including the lead it is 68 for 4, still not enough. AUSvIND INDvAUS   With Pujara gone for a duck, Australia slightly ahead now in the game. Huge responsibility on Kohli and Agarwal now. AUSvIND INDvAUS
Predictions for today:- Boomrah 0-5, Agarwal 18-27, Pujara 20-29, Kohli 128-137  AUSvIND INDvsAUS India in a strong position here. It should win the Test hereon. AUSvIND INDvAUS   Does  have such flaws in his batting technique which have been exposed by the opposition as what Shaw has? NO. Then why didn't the selectors choose him instead of the erroneous PrithviShaw?   Earthquake tremors felt in parts of national capital, hope everyone is safe.

AUSvIND INDvAUS Did India deliberately left only 5/6 overs to bat in the night session 🤔

AUSvIND INDvAUS If India can score 200 in their 2nd innings , it will be their game to lose .. 

AUSvIND INDvAUS Smith prepared for short pitch stuff from Indian pacers, went on to dare them, meanwhile Ashwin sheepishly came out of syllabus 

AUSvIND INDvAUS _05_ if India dont lose any further wickets in the day , many will forgive him  it can still be India's day, provided the run out dont trigger a collapse  can't keep him away from action  just before T20 world cup i guess. The pitch isn't as bad Indian batting made it look AUSvIND INDvAUS  Those amateur IPL fans &amp; some so called cricket experts like  who were making fun of  for leaking runs during IPL2020 should go &amp; wash their faces.This is real cricket &amp; real perfomance when the contest is even AUSvINDtest INDvsAUS Australia KKR This Innings is reminding me of durban test 1996 SA tour where India was bundled out for 100 &amp; 66 in 1st and 2nd Innings    INDvsAUSTest   Needlessly Complicating a straightforward situation.

तरी आम्ही कुणाच्या बापाला घाबरत नाही : खासदार संजय राऊत  This is the India we know and love. Sab changa si. INDvAUS AUSvIND Instead of  , they should nick name Labuschampagne as Steve. Makes more sense. AUSvIND  INDvAUS If the batter walks immediately after the DRS is taken (since he knows he is out), their team should get an additional review for saving everyone's time. AUSvIND INDvsAUS  _mania Why do I remember a lot of bye-runs with Pant keeping? 

My Saha replacement is KL. Pant is not bad. He is left handed which our team lacks now. 

I just remember that fateful day when KL and Pant almost made Eng cry on the fifth day. A great heist that never happened. (3/n) I don't know what the likes of Vijay Shankar and Shivam Dubey are doing outside the field. There is such a great opportunity just waiting for them. Life could not have handed a bigger silver platter to these two. (2/n) You need the best wk in tests as mistakes are much more costly. 

Sadly, none of our top six can bowl even an over.

This is assuming Hardik can bowl.

Vihari can pile tons and tons in domestic cricket. But he still does not instill some confidence. (1/n) India's best test lineup at the moment would be- 

Rohit, Mayank, Pujara, Kohli, Rahane, Saha, Hardik, Ashwin, Shami, Bumrah, Ishant.

NZvsPAK babarazam  Its not time for humour. India must demand Kohli resignation. What a disgrace in his captaincy. Instead of picking Shubhman who was looking solid, he chose underconfident Shaw, which started the collapse. Couldn't wrap up tail quickly. Too many careers destroyed Main toh bhaag raha hoon, Maine toh planning bhi waise kiya hain kohli INDvsAUS   The media and current management feed off each other. To justify their errors or promote a player, long claims such as Sachin,MSD comparison are made. Media scrutinized those decisions. INDvAUS   Said this before, say that again, aamir is the most insecure actor in Bollywood. He just can't act in a film that has a good role for any other actor other than him, be it, villain, supporting actor, even heroine.Ideal cast should be a North, south combo      PrithviShaw again got out due to his technical issue, but, Mayank is also trending. So, reminding again, if not, see twitter, if you score anything less than 100,YOU WILL BE DROPPED.Soft hands,no cheeky singles,no fishing outside off, straight bat, no gap,leave a lot, patience. Dont understand why put so much expectations on young players &amp; bog them down, it happened with Pant, calling him the next MSD, now we are seeing the same thing happen with PrithviShaw. Let him toil in Ranji trophy. More games like this will demoralize him further. INDvAUS Shaw  Thats why one should not attempt cheeky singles in test cricket.    He looks like Raavan Adipurush and has already played a menacing villain to Prabhas   Remember or write it down somewhere, when Rohit returns, you will be dropped. A Mumbai cricketer always gets more chances than any other cricketer than anywhere in the world. Second inns will decide your fate. RememberKarunNair   All the more reason to let him find himself in ranji trophy.  भूकम्प आया था आपका कुछ गिरा तो नहीं..! 🤣 RipFarmersRipDemocracy

AUSvIND INDvAUS That one run out changed the game on its head!

AUSvIND Rahane changed the course of the game!

AUSvIND Pujara with his approach almost consumed Kohli too. Luckily for India, he got out before that. Now on runs will come when offered.

AUSvIND Test cricket existing beacuse, its so so different from T20. You need not watch every over in test cricket. You can take your own breaks of 15 minutes and come back for almost no difference in scores. AUSvIND INDvAUS Its TEST for bowlers. Pujara is just the element for it. He never try to dominate the bowlers. So selfless. Never tries to prove he is a good batsman to play white ball cricket. He is there just to improve the consistency and accuracy of opponent bowlers.

We have to accept that kohli is a pathetic captain, and Shastri is a better commentator then coach. Horrible Show by Team India. INDvsAUSTest INDvsAUS Is it necessary that whenever Kohli gets the captaincy of any team, it'll break it's lowest score record? Also the coach of Team India is himself a legend, Mr. "Ravi Shastri" 🤦.

RaviShastri   Lots of love from telugu states -   fans ❤️   4 + 8 = 12 Team India today.

INDvAUS  Jadeja is a bowler who can bat.

 PrithviShaw is a batsman who cannot bat.

INDvAUS He meant only by physical appearance. 

By cricketing talent, he is more like Manjrekar.

INDvAUS Lara Sachin Sehwag PrithviShaw   Always wears uncomfortable shorts 😂 CSK is depreciated... And probably impaired. 
CSKvsRCB Anushka is responsible for Virat's performance in the same way SunilGavaskar is responsible for failed cricket career of his son rohangavaskar _one We are picking the tough catches. The ones we drop are such that a school team coach can teach. Jhonty wouldn't have made much of a difference, but why would anyone reject him I don't get. _one This has been the Achilles Heel for India since long back. Nothing new with that. 
BTW how did u pull out the data? Did u manually go through each match? 😯😯  Yeah we lost atleast 50 runs because of that. Thankfully we still restricted them to 191 If Australian or English team had been out for this score, there would've been a complete overhaul of their team. If  decides to keep Shastri even after this, I don't know what to expect. ShastriOut   U still feel the same? He got out in identical fashion to how Jofra and Boult were getting him in IPL. If a player is so woefully out of form that he can't get past first over (he couldn't even in IPL) it's better to drop him till he finds his form.  Kohli has already cleared the air with that-he said he needs to bowl. Also I don't think Vihari should be replaced. Even today he scored 8🤣🤣 India's batting has been letting us down for some time, and this is the lowest low. Lowest ever test score by India, by a so-called best ever Indian team. All the batsmen out in ditto same fashion. Usually I am optimistic but this is a shame. INDvsAUS IndianCricketTeam  No no u can trust Virat with that. This "RCB quota" thing is bs, made up. Bhuvi is gonna walk in once he is fit. 
He may not be selected in the XI according to the pitch conditions though _one  We didn't have to go through this in 2011-12, and that tour was HORRIFIC. 
Atleast then things would be over before we woke up🤣🤣  Well he is not. He will walk into the test squad once he is fit   You are on fire with your stats   😂😂😂   For our Mental Health We need to stop watching the game sir  He was appointed as Consultant on Overseas tours

INDvsAUSTest    Don't worry they are conducting a IPL in April may to give more practice .   _Tiwari Don't worry nothing will happen.
This is test cricket no one cares.
Better to name the T20 cup as Border Gavaskar trophy because it's clear no one cares for this test trophy from the Indian side _Ramasane As a captain he is responsible. It is his team that he is selected. No body I mean no body in cricket fertility has the guts to question Virat Kohli after this historic surrender.
Any other captain would certainly lose his captaincy.

 INDvsAUSTest  A school team would have at least scored 50.
INDvsAUSTest  Any Captain will tender his resignation after such history making  surrender.
But this is Virat kohli.  If this the standard than no need of such embarrassment.
Virat ji to wapas aarahe h let other so called test cricketers also come back Nothing will happen after this surrender.
No one cares for test .
May be better to change the border gavaskar trophy to T20 from test.

PrithviShaw INDvAUS  KL Rahul Kohli Starc Prithvi Shaw, just as it was expected. As harsh as it may sound, I will always blame the captain for this decision. INDvAUS Shaw  _haider I anyhow feel, India will give a major setback to the Australians  and win the Sydney test. MARK MY WORDS.  _haider We know sir and we all love you. But I think, India learns from their mistake and then changes things. Pakistan lacks that a little, what I feel in my opinion. But my question is Galti pehle karein hi kyun? We should choose the best, when we have the best.  _haider A man bears the fruit of what he plants. Jo boyenge, wahi khayenge! Hope, India ke liye yeh phal meetha nikale! 🙂  _haider Really want you to keep your views on this disappointing decision, looking forwars to it. The first test really matters a lot. And opening is test is a serious matter.  _leoFC  _haider And Prithvi Shaw is? _leoFC  _haider No doubt. Rahul is my number one choice. Mayank and Rahul’s partnership is well tested. No point wasting it and giving a chance to someone who least deserves it from the three. INDvAUS victory not far away  Destruction

AusvInd  Simpson averaged 33.67 in 23 Tests as a player and 54.07 in 39 Tests as captain. However he was an outstanding slip fielder and useful leg-break bowler too.  The youngest England captain to score 100 is Alastair Cook  who was 25y 77d when he scored 173 v Bangladesh at Chittagong on 12/13 March (158* at close of 12 March) 2010.  At the other end of the scale Tatenda Taibu is the youngest Test captain to score a 100 when he made 153 v Bangladesh at Dhaka on 17 January 2005 aged 21y 248d.  Working-class men, in the borough constituencies, were first enfranchised in 1867. It was non-householders, of all social groups, who were not responsible for paying rates to the local authority who were disenfranchised until 1918, probably about 5.4m men.  Do we live in a free society or not? Allowing people to take personal responsibility for Christmas and everything else may have some downsides but it is wholly superior to how affairs are managed in Russia or China.  Problem is there is no vacancy at the moment and, secondly, Islington North will disappear anyway once long-postponed redistribution of constituencies boundaries is completed. Dhoni ♥️🔥

Tested and grinded through those scenarios time and time out gives you the G.O.A.T tag..
For me that's the real thing..

Hope u understood what i meant.. 2/2 _fan Bro i hope u didn't misunderstood me.
Having a great stat /number to your name definitely makes u good player but the quality and class of the player shows when he's tested in severe conditions and that's what makes you Great from good.
In test Player like King &amp; Smith can.. 1/2 _fan Good bowler in favourable conditions. _fan Bro his most test hundreds are in Australian batting friendly flat tracks. Not much of a tough task. But ya they're test runs in stats so good that way but taking about the quality of the player he's just FTB. Plot Twist:

This entire tour is just designed for Joe Burns to finally cement his place in the Australian line up.

 my weekend started with absolute nightmare cos of Indian cricket team and what's waiting for me is my football team  man utd face high pressing Leeds who also happens to be rival weekend godsaveme I thought only Manchester United can hurt me emotionally , but team india manged it .. not in a wildest dream i expected this.. no backbone.. i just miss someone with jersey no.7 and i m the biggest critic of him INDvsAUS  dhoni _topc Yup cos last time out out batting was very good.. this time too many new faces.. we needed Rohit,pant,pandya _topc Playing relatively inexperienced players for the first time in aus vs the best ever pace attack the world has ever seen..too bad by coaching staff and selectors Selectors or kohli.. who should pay the price?.. INDvsAUS Unacceptable INDvAUS Exactly my thoughts too.. not upto this level ... atleast for now   It may sound harsh but he doesn't belong to international level.. not only here but on NZ and in Dubai for IPL.. need to pick a solid opener i would say to an extent like a Murali Vijay mould Kohli and team management have to be responsible for Shaw's flop... Why pick a batsman who is out of form actually looks like he don't belong to this level INDvsAUS Hey! Guys!

 and   is more important for Indian🇮🇳 Batting Line-up Excitement India. Back In India's first Inning - Saha's 9 in 26 balls and Ashwin's 15 in 20 balls was a Confidence Booster for TeamIndia. Because ye (Saha and Ashwin) Jaldi Out Hote 'to' Bharat Jaldi All Out hota. So 26+20=46 Balls was very useful for India🇮🇳. 9 Wickets is in Our Hand🇮🇳 , King Kohli' Only One More Inning is Left in 2020! Hopefully he will make a Big Score Tomorrow.❤️👊 If Run Machine will Dominate then India will also Dominate.🤗👏

AUSvIND 😿  In a modern society traditions and other practices grow out of similarities rather than differences between people. This system can have serious consequences as it creates divison within the society and at the same time leaves all the waste untreated. With efficient governance both these issues can be resolved. Steps have been taken and work is in progress. (8/n) 
SwachhBharat Whether that dirt has been disposed off or not was not a matter of concern. This is just like what we see with the litter boxes today. People just throw the waste around them instead of throwing it in because they don't care until it affects their own hygiene. (7/n) Due to similar reasons they were also regarded as untouchables because people felt that they would get contaminated if they go near them. However, the point is here is that people just want to done away with dirt from near surroundings which includes their houses,offices etc(6/n) _Point_ KL-Gayle

Nobody could believe this! What a shame for ,  &amp; the bloody !
Black day for Indian fans!
INDvAUS INDvsAUS AUSvIND AUSvsIND  Can’t believe this is India’s scorecard! 
What a Horror show of batting!
Not a single double digit is there!
One of the greatest hours of fast bowling I have ever seen!

What a shame for TeamIndia! Now who is responsible for this?
INDvAUS INDvsAUS AUSvIND AUSvIND  And PrithviShaw repeated the same! He was slow at it! But the ball didn’t!
We didn’t get a good start!
Shocking to see Bumrah as a night watchman!
But well played Bumrah!
INDvsAUS INDvsAUSTest AUSvIND AUSvsIND  Bumrah 😱
INDvsAUS INDvsAUSTest AUSvIND AUSvsIND He took the game away from Pakistan!
Pakistan fought really well! Specially the bowling! They tried their best to defend the total!
NZvsPAK NZvPAK PakvsNz PAKvNZ  PrithviShaw seems in pressure!Pressure already for 1st inning failure and dropping sitter. Now batting in this tough time!
INDvsAUS INDvAUS AUSvIND AUSvsIND So how do you like it!
Don’t tell me you expected the score!
53 runs isn’t that much big but it matters on this pitch!
Hope we will have a good batting session!
INDvsAUS INDvsAUSTest AUSvIND AUSvsIND  This is probably wishful thinking, but looking forward to a dramatic fightback in the next session. AUSvIND We have to give it to them; Cummins and Hazlewood bowled exceptionally well and asked the right questions of the Indian batsmen. AUSvIND Takes a rather special effort to even perform the way our batters did. AUSvIND Will be difficult to move past this. AUSvIND Looking at what Marnus is picking up, Smith might tone his mannerisms down a bit. :D INDvAUS Marnus looks all over the place. INDvAUS A little fuller and straighter might help. INDvAUS Even though the scorecard at the moment may suggest otherwise, the Aussie openers haven't looked and/or been troubled at all. INDvAUS I think one reason why the Aussie quicks were more effective early on was they attacked the stumps far more than their Indian counterparts are doing so at the moment. INDvAUS Not much lateral movement off the deck for Bumrah or Umesh.  Have managed to keep things quiet so far.

INDvAUS AUSvIND INDvsAUSTest viratkholi Bumrah Rahane Kohli Adelaide Ravi Shastri Team India Hazlewood Pujara  Saha  _barthwal ब्यखुनि की राम -राम या शुभ ब्यखुनि यहां ममता दीदी को उनके विधायक, सांसद और नेता झटके पर झटके दिए जा रहे हैं।  विराट कोहली के भारत लौटने से पहले उनके नाम शर्मनाक रिकॉर्ड दर्ज़ हो गया है। क्या वो अब भी वापस आना चाहेंगे या परिस्थितियों से लड़कर टीम को जीत की राह दिखाएंगे? अच्छे कप्तान से इस समय क्या उम्मीद होगी भारतीय दर्शकों की जो सबसे ज्यादा क्रिकेट से प्यार करते हैं। 

INDvsAUSTest Saha सुबह = फजल लेकि 
दोपहर = दोफरा 
शाम = ब्यखुनि  इससे उन्हें लगता है कि शायद उनकी दूकान चल जाएगी या किसानों की सहानुभूति मिलेगी या विपक्ष के लोगों का साथ या उन्हें लगता है कि जनता बेवकूफ है, जो ये बोलेंगे वही सच है बाकी सब बकवास है।

INDvAUS Why this loser PrithviShaw is preferred over ShubhmanGill and RishabhPant ?
Has BCCI lost mind?
INDvAUS  Hey loser! How are you?    ??? Seriously? Swag level 💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥
Losers at  , kab sudhroge?  ❤️
Live long  ! Thank you very much Sir!   Thank you  for your contribution to Indian cricket! Jaise batting line up hai humari captain koi bhi banne we will lose all the remaining matches. 2 batsmen se series koi Jeet paaya hai aaj Tak ? AUSvIND INDvAUS Batsmen*  Captain can't do anything in other's poor batting, and India have only two reliable batsmen. Now I'm sure India will lose all the remaining matches phir chahe captaincy koi bhi Kare. The thing with our Indian team is, when our two reliable batsmen (Kohli and Pujara) fail then whole team fails. At least Ganguly's team had 5 reliable batsmen with handy tailenders. WorryingSign
AUSvIND AUSvsIND INDvAUS Aussies caught almost all the catches and we dropped 80% of catches. Indian team have done every mistake in this test match, run out to poor batting and poor fielding. AUSvIND INDvAUS I hope Shami's injury is not that serious, wish him speedy recovery. Josh Hazelwood is a freak, one of the best bowling spell I've seen in my life. 🙌 AUSvIND INDvAUS  We gave them extra 40-50 runs by our poor fielding.  1st inning does matter in test cricket if Kohli wasn't run-out in 1st inning we would've scored 300+, and it was obvious that we gonna fail in 3rd inning against new ball on 3rd day. Now, that run-out of Kohli and poor fielding by our players hurt so much. AUSvIND INDvAUS  😁😁 INDvsAUSTest 

*For those Who still thinking That Team india Gonna win this Test Cricket Match-:  _Chhup 😓  _Chhup 😓😁😁 .  One test match on a rank turner in Nagpur/Chennai. Ashwin, Jadeja, Kuldeep bundling up Aussies under 36 runs. I'm waiting for the revenge day. I will not be able to focus on anything for the next few days.  Thanks to the Indian batting lineup. Only rain can save us. Not even a single player is in double digit. Bc RCB bna diya hai suaro ne WTFFFF JUST HAPPENED!!!

It can be in your favour sometimes but it will hurt when it goes against you. A little unfair! BorderGavaskarTrophy INDvAUS  _haider Looking at the conditions, I am really excited to watch India bowl. It would be a battle to watch. Cannot wait for Shami, Bumrah &amp; Yadav. Let’s put up a decent total for them! INDvAUS  _haider Ravi Shastri: There is a little bit of Sachin, Sehwag and Lara in Prtihvi Shaw. 
Public: O pata nahi ji kaunsa nasha karta hai!
PrithviShaw INDvAUS  KL Rahul Kohli Starc Prithvi Shaw, just as it was expected. As harsh as it may sound, I will always blame the captain for this decision. INDvAUS Shaw  _haider I anyhow feel, India will give a major setback to the Australians  and win the Sydney test. MARK MY WORDS.  _haider We know sir and we all love you. But I think, India learns from their mistake and then changes things. Pakistan lacks that a little, what I feel in my opinion. But my question is Galti pehle karein hi kyun? We should choose the best, when we have the best.  _haider A man bears the fruit of what he plants. Jo boyenge, wahi khayenge! Hope, India ke liye yeh phal meetha nikale! 🙂  _haider Really want you to keep your views on this disappointing decision, looking forwars to it. The first test really matters a lot. And opening is test is a serious matter.  _leoFC  _haider And Prithvi Shaw is? _leoFC  _haider No doubt. Rahul is my number one choice. Mayank and Rahul’s partnership is well tested. No point wasting it and giving a chance to someone who least deserves it from the three. IndvAus 31/8. INDIA IndvAus INDIA 15/4. IndvsAus 7,000 followers up. Thanks all for following.

INDvAUS Anyone having a short temper problem and wishes to inculcate self-control and the ability to remain calm can watch this innings as therapy. INDvAUS I'd be an idiot to blame Kohli for this collapse. I admit that his leadership skills are not on Dhoni's level but how is he supposed to control how other batsmen of the team play? INDvAUS _classygirl How? It's not his fault if the whole team decided to flop today.  _classygirl I don't see anything wrong with the team selection, apart from Shaw? That's done.

TeamIndia were bowled out for 36. Their previous lowest ever total in a test innings was 42 made against England at Lord’s in 1974😱 

Watch how the horror unfolded on Saturday morning- 👇

 AUSvIND INDvAUS

Australia start the second session on a bright note, hitting three boundaries in three overs. 

The hosts need 51 more runs to win.

 The start date of the main draw of AusOpen was originally slated for January 18 and organisers have been locked in negotiations with the local government over COVID-19 health protocols.

 INDvAUS 

It was not less than a nightmare to watch Australia taking 5/4 in a 35-ball spell on Day 3 of the pink-ball Test at Adelaide on Saturday.

 INDvAUS 

India's earlier lowest score was 42 at the Lord's in 1974 against England, known in Indian cricket parlance as "Summer of 42".

 Spurs had just 24 percent of the ball and 19 passes in the final third compared to Liverpool’s 200 but Mourinho insisted the better team had lost

 ViratKohli is gone as well! 😱 This is a shocker on a Saturday!

We have good medical facilities in India🇮🇳 you may visit some doctors here..       does team practice deliberate ploy to keep poor over rate in first 2 session to bowl max overs under light in last session? In Day night test match??  Since Lyon was bowling round the wicket, kohli was at over the wicket side as non striker he cannot look at the ball and run. He had to trust the partner. If Lyon was bowling over the wicket, kohli would have had the sight of the ball standing as non striker..       On pink ball and under lights bowlers attacking the stumps are more likely to succeed so expecting a fifer from Boom..

My advice :
🌟Remove Ravi Shastri.
🌟Bring Rahul Dravid as team India coach.
🌟 Select the Indian test cricket team on the basis of First class cricket and stop selecting team on IPL basis.

AUSvIND We have to give it to them; Cummins and Hazlewood bowled exceptionally well and asked the right questions of the Indian batsmen. AUSvIND Takes a rather special effort to even perform the way our batters did. AUSvIND Will be difficult to move past this. AUSvIND Looking at what Marnus is picking up, Smith might tone his mannerisms down a bit. :D INDvAUS Marnus looks all over the place. INDvAUS A little fuller and straighter might help. INDvAUS Even though the scorecard at the moment may suggest otherwise, the Aussie openers haven't looked and/or been troubled at all. INDvAUS I think one reason why the Aussie quicks were more effective early on was they attacked the stumps far more than their Indian counterparts are doing so at the moment.

I mean seriously he/she is a Trash😭  It's like  legspin bowling 🤣   Great work 👍👍👍 Ariiii 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  Perfect description in  's words 😂
 
INDvAUS  Yes. No matter how horrible it was for us Indians, such beautiful bowling display by Cummins and Josh.  Ind should think they have last 2 overs and 20 runs to win and bat to win the game.
100+ target at least 😂
INDvAUS I miss the days when test match used to be for 5 days. Hate these 3 day test matches.
INDvAUS  Neat aagi bagsi hodidru 😂 That's it!! Ind will not even give a target of 100+ 😂
Virat also back!!
INDvAUS 15-5!!!
What the bloody shit fuck is happening.
INDvAUS  I swear!! Wtf is happening 😂 Somehow we just can't stand and build in second innings. 🤦‍♂️
3rd wicket down!!
INDvAUS It took them 3 innings to get  out in their own turf!! 🤭

Bumrah _Bujji Mass pannityae nu sonnen😹 _Bujji Powlichitiyae 👏😽 Bye!😽👋  Hii! Shami injured,virat gone!!!
India have lost the perfect chance to win the test match. Without these two the future sure does look grim at the moment for the rest of the series. The lead would've been more than 130 had we not dropped catches Match ending today😢😢😢 Australia have literally just destroyed India 😢 Predicting big runs from mayank Aggarwal and virat kohli today.
INDvsAUS 
movingday  Preach  If india want to secure a draw atleast we need to bat for atleast a day and a half probably till twilight of the 4th day. India need a lead of about 400+ to secure a draw or a win. Predicting a big innings from Mayank and Kohli. Haven't seen something as true as this.  Bumrah and Hardik are the only good thing that mumbai Indians have done. You could almost ignore their toxic fanbase because of these two. Australia need 90 runs to win!

PinkBallTest  Very relevant observations, Mrin. When the captain has the most secure job with so much veto power and no accountability (look at RCB), when the coach has bombast and little else, and when the Board President is a walking example of all sorts of conflict of interests - you get Adelaide, Dec 19, 2020.
INDvAUS India 36/9.
Just 7 runs to reach the target.

INDvAUS Disaster.

And for Sony Sports. An entire summer ruined in just under an hour. 
INDvAUS Outstanding. Can't help but tag   and  
Srirangam does not fail to amaze and astound. 🙏🏾🙏🏾   Reminds me of Charles Ellis suggestion in his book Winning the Losers Game - Don't just stand there. Do something. Should be changed to -
Don't do something. Just stand there.   Fantastic. Like someone has placed a Ruby for an eye.       _aashish        Indeed a terrific list. Always insightful, incisive, analytical and credible.    Nanjamma is definitely one of the greatest female characters in Indian fiction. Hard to read Gruhabhanga with a dry eye. Superb acting too.  Heartfelt condolences, Mr. Dalio. May his soul rest in eternal peace.  Yeah, but you also have to admit Bowling has been top class. And if pujara and kohli gone. Nothing much you can expect from our batsman.  Esp. In overseas test.  I don't want to troll any player, but it's some rohit fans who incite me to do this.  But checked on you. You aren't like other rohit fans. Cheers!  Says a Rohit fan, Okay. It's too harsh on batsman, Actually Bowling has been Apart class from Australia.

AUSvIND Kohli  Although I do feel this attack has gone from strength-to-strength since. Cummins &amp; Hazlewood were magnificent in the Ashes. Smith &amp; Warner were missing in 2018/19, but I personally didn't take credit away from India because they beat Australia with this same bowling attack. It is a magnificent attack.

It shows how important Pujara is to this team.

I won't be surprised if Australia declares after 10overs by scoring quick runs runs now.

I think need to be bit defensive without giving away runs.

If they get them all out by 10overs then we need to face new ball under the lights for atleast 15 overs.

And then, wham!! The big C

Life, what can you do but live it eh?   Your visualisation helped with my radiotherapy as well. I always imagined the radiation attacking my cancer cells exactly like this. 💜 This immediately made me think of the part in Down to Agincourt where Castiel describes Dean’s immune system fighting Croatoan

Surgery to replace part of cheek and jaw and radiotherapy got rid of the cancer. 

Now me and my stick blender are very happy together 🍐🍇🍉🍏🥭🥐🥖🥨🍕🥪🍨🍧=🥫🍜   Would u blv b4 this hit out of left field last year I could have said the same abt me. 

Very rare instances of being sick even with the sniffles

And then, wham!! The big C

Life, what can you do but live it eh?   Your visualisation helped with my radiotherapy as well. I always imagined the radiation attacking my cancer cells exactly like this. 💜 This immediately made me think of the part in Down to Agincourt where Castiel describes Dean’s immune system fighting Croatoan

“An army unseen but vast, its numbers beyond counting, has just picked up their swords.”

   Well i must admit I’ve owned one of those models for years and it’s a wild ride....  Great thread explaining the Covid19 vaccine and how it functions

 Perfect description in  's words 😂
 
INDvAUS  Yes. No matter how horrible it was for us Indians, such beautiful bowling display by Cummins and Josh.  Ind should think they have last 2 overs and 20 runs to win and bat to win the game.
100+ target at least 😂
INDvAUS I miss the days when test match used to be for 5 days. Hate these 3 day test matches.
INDvAUS  Neat aagi bagsi hodidru 😂 That's it!! Ind will not even give a target of 100+ 😂
Virat also back!!
INDvAUS 15-5!!!
What the bloody shit fuck is happening.
INDvAUS  I swear!! Wtf is happening 😂 Somehow we just can't stand and build in second innings. 🤦‍♂️
3rd wicket down!!
INDvAUS It took them 3 innings to get  out in their own turf!! 🤭
INDvAUS 
Bumrah   It exposed our pathetic middle and lower order, we need guys like Hardik, Pant, Jadeja in the lower middle order in case we lose early wickets like today  why is that the fielders are not on the boundary or inside the circle, thats is why they are jumping awfully and dropping catches  Shami was also exceptional with the ball, he always gets under rated, he constantly applied pressure from one end, and he bowled with lot of variety bouncers, and to the stumps  We need Pant, Hardik and Jadeja in these scenarios, they will get a good 50 to take the team to a good total, not Sahas and the Ashwins contributing to a longish tail  Miss you on 7 mate  After Sehwag retired, India in TEST cricket has gone backwards  We need Pant, Hardik and Jadeja in these scenarios, they will get a good 50 to take the team to a good total, not Sahas and the Ashwins contributing to a longish tail  We need Pant, Hardik and Jadeja in these scenarios, they will get a good 50 to take the team to a good total, not Sahas and the Ashwins contributing to a longish tail Demoting Shami below Bumrah could have heated up Shami well when he comes out to Bowl, at the same time Bumrah will come to bowl with the happiness of getting a promotion :)  Thats a horrible feeling, and Shami is a far better dazzer than that Kohli no century in 2020 in any format? 
 

I think after the 36 carnage, nothing can surprise us.

This entire tour is just designed for Joe Burns to finally cement his place in the Australian line up.

INDvsAUSTest  Right, just yesterday a small cousin sent me a Santa doll he made himself.
